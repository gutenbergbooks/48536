<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>

<p>When Jerry, Ned and Bob returned from an
automobile ride one day, and saw a great crowd
around the railroad station of their home town,
they were somewhat excited. They were made
more so when they saw Jim Nestor, the foreman
of the mine in which they held an interest, and
another Westerner, wildly digging on the tracks.
And when they heard the murmurs of “gold,”
they did not know what to think.</p>

<p>And from then on they were involved in happenings
that did not cease when they set out to
recover the sixty nuggets, so strangely hidden
on the border. Though the gold on the railroad
tracks did not amount to much, the other pocket
of the precious yellow metal did, as you will learn
in the pages that follow.</p>

<p>In this book you may also read of the search
Professor Snodgrass made for some luminous
snakes, and how he found them; and I have also
taken pleasure in writing for you an account of
how Noddy Nixon tried to get away from the
motor boys the gold they worked so hard for,
and how our heroes braved even the perils of a
band of Blackfeet Indians, who had escaped from
their reservation.</p>

<p>That you will like this book as well as you have
the others of the series, is the sincere wish of</p>

<p class="rightpad">Your true friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Clarence Young</span>.</p>

<small>QUEER ACTIONS</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter, Bob, can’t you crank an
auto yet?”</p>

<p>“I sure can!” exclaimed a stout lad, who was
bending over in front of a big car, laboriously
grinding away at the starting handle.</p>

<p>“Then do it,” advised a tall youth at the wheel.
“Turn it over good and hard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go ahead,” put in a good-natured looking
chap in one of the rear seats. “We don’t
want to stay here all day, even if it is a nice place.”</p>

<p>“All—right—here—she—goes!” panted stout
Bob Baker, as he again turned the crank.</p>

<p>There was only the noise of the flywheel spinning
around; a sort of cough and wheeze, but no
whirr and throb that told of an explosion of gas
in the cylinders.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you can’t get her started let me try!”
exclaimed Ned Slade, the lad in the tonneau. “I
thought you’d had practice enough, Bob.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” remarked Jerry Hopkins, the
lad at the wheel. “Keep at it, Bob, it’ll take off
some of that extra flesh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you——!” began the fat lad, and then
he stopped to gaze in some astonishment at his
chum, Ned, who had started to leave the rear
seat, with the evident intention of trying his hand
at the crank. For on Ned’s face there was a curious
look as he gazed over Jerry’s shoulder at
the switch, just under the overhang on the dashboard
of the car. Then a broad grin illuminated
Ned’s features, to be succeeded by a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“Huh!” ejaculated Bob. “I don’t see anything
to go into spasms over. If you think it’s so
funny come out here and try it yourself. I never
saw such a cranky car. It went all right a while
ago, and now——”</p>

<p>“It’s all because you don’t know how to crank
it—that’s the reason it’s cranky,” began Jerry.
“I’ll show you——”</p>

<p>“No—don’t—Oh, ho! Sit still—Oh, me!
Oh my! Wait until I get my breath—Oh
dear!” and Ned with one hand on the steersman’s
shoulder held his own side with the other to help
repress his mirth.</p>

<p>“Well of all the——” began Bob, half in anger.</p>

<p>“No wonder he couldn’t crank it!” cried Ned.
“You haven’t got the switch on, Jerry. There’s
no current—Oh dear! and to think that Bob was
breaking his back and never getting a spark——”</p>

<p>“Was that the trouble?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“It sure was,” replied Ned, and, stepping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the footboard he reached to the dash, and snapped
on the switch which connected the batteries with
the spark plug in the cylinder heads. “Now try
it, Bob!” he called.</p>

<p>“Not much!” exclaimed the fat lad, with great
determination. “I’m done—finished! If you
fellows don’t know enough to throw on the switch
after all these years of running a car, and then
expect to sit there and grin your heads off while
I break my back cranking, you’re mighty much
mistaken—that’s all I’ve got to say. You may
think it’s a joke, but I don’t! I’m through with
you,” and turning on his heel, after flashing a
look at his two chums, Bob Baker started off
down the road afoot.</p>

<p>“Here, where are you going?” called Jerry,
after him.</p>

<p>“Home!” was the short answer, “and I’m
not going out with you fellows again in a
hurry!”</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry looked at one another. It was
the first time in a long while that there had been
any serious difference among the three chums.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on back!” urged Ned, for he saw
that Bob was very much in earnest. “Come on
back.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” snapped Bob. “I’m
through.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean anything,” went on Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
starting after his friend. “But it was so funny
to see——”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Joke!” sneered Bob. “If it’s
so funny write it out and send it to the humorous
column. You won’t get another chance to laugh
at me, though.”</p>

<p>“He’s mad, all right,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>“Looks so,” agreed Jerry. “Oh, I say
Bob!” the tall lad went on, “come on back.
Honest, I didn’t know the switch was off. Come
on back. It’s a good ways to Cresville, and we’ve
only just started the run. Come on back, and
you can steer, and I’ll crank up. And if we get
a puncture Ned and I’ll put on a new tire, and
you won’t even have to get out of the car. I
mean it!”</p>

<p>The figure, stalking down the road in anger,
was seen to hesitate the merest trifle. But Bob
did not turn around.</p>

<p>“That almost fetched him,” said Jerry. “Say
something, Ned.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stop at the first place we come to, and
get a bite to eat, even if it isn’t noon,” shouted the
lad who had discovered the disconnected switch.
“That ought to do the business,” he added, in
lower tones.</p>

<p>It seemed to be, for Bob halted, appeared to be
considering the matter at length, and then turned
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does all that go?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Sure,” chorused Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>“And about me not having to help sweat putting
on a tire?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Jerry assured him. Bob came
slowly back.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he spoke as he climbed into
the tonneau, “it was no fun cranking a car with
the switch off.”</p>

<p>“We agree with you,” said Jerry, winking at
Ned with the eye concealed from his offended
chum. “But it wasn’t intentional,” he added,
soothingly, as he went to the crank. “Go ahead,
Bob, you can steer if you want to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I want to. If we get a
puncture you might blame it on me.”</p>

<p>“All right, then I’ll take the wheel,” went on
Jerry, as the motor throbbed and hummed when
he had turned the crank, for the car, though a
good one, was not a self-starter.</p>

<p>“But everything else goes,” proceeded Bob,
as the machine glided smoothly down the road.
“And we stop at the first place where we
can get sandwiches and ginger ale. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“You always——” began Ned, but Jerry
stopped him with a nudge in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Keep your foot on the soft pedal,” he advised,
in a whisper, for the two lads were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
front seat, with Bob in the rear. “No use getting
him ruffled again.”</p>

<p>The three chums had taken advantage of a fine
spring day to take a ride in their auto about the
country near Cresville, a town not far from
Boston. They had not gone far before they came
to a delightful spot, where a roadside spring offered
a chance to drink, and they took it. In
stopping the car, Jerry had thrown out the switch,
and when, with their thirst quenched, they wanted
to start off again, the incident I have just narrated
took place.</p>

<p>But now everything seemed to have been
smoothed out, though Bob thought to himself that
he had gotten a little the best of the bargain. He
felt sure his chums had played no trick on him, in
having him crank up without the switch being on,
for it frequently had happened before that one
of them forgot to make the electrical connection.</p>

<p>“But I get out of that tire work,” thought Bob,
as the car swung along; “and they won’t guy me
when I want something to eat. I guess we’re
even.”</p>

<p>“Going to any place in particular?” asked
Ned of Jerry, as the tall lad swung the machine
around a curve.</p>

<p>“No, I just thought we’d run out for ten miles
or so, and get back in time for lunch. Or we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
can stop at a roadhouse, and spend the whole day
touring if you like. I was going——”</p>

<p>“Look out!” suddenly yelled Bob, for Jerry
had turned to speak to Ned, and his eyes were not
on the road ahead. “Look out or you’ll go over
that dog!”</p>

<p>There was a scurrying in the dust as a yellow
cur rushed from a roadside house, directly at the
auto. Bob spoke only just in time, for Jerry,
with a quick turn of the wheel, sent the car to one
side with a dangerous swerve, but avoiding the
dog.</p>

<p>The beast, with sharp barks, seemed to enjoy
the confusion he had caused. Jerry, with muttered
comments on all such dogs in general, and this one
in particular, was swinging back into the road
again, when there came a sharp hiss of air, and
the auto settled slightly on one side.</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” cried Ned. “A puncture!”</p>

<p>“It was that dog’s fault!” exclaimed Jerry,
wrathfully. “I hit that board with a nail in it
when I turned out for him. We ought to make
the man who owns him pay us for a brand new
tire.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned, while Jerry
guided the disabled car beneath a big tree, that
they might take advantage of the shade in substituting
a new inner tube for the punctured one.
The dog, evidently thinking that the lads were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
stopping to take revenge on him, fled into the
house, his tail between his legs.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I watch you fellows work!”
exclaimed Bob, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“All right! What we said goes!” declared
Jerry. “Come on, Ned. Get busy.”</p>

<p>The car was soon jacked up, and the shoe taken
off by Jerry, while Ned got out a new inner tube
and proceeded to partially inflate it ready to slip
it in in place of the damaged one.</p>

<p>“Say, this shoe sticks!” said Jerry, who was
working hard. “Here, Ned, give me a hand.”</p>

<p>“Can’t for a minute. I’ve got to fill this tube.”</p>

<p>“Aw, say, I’ll help!” exclaimed Bob, who, all
the while, in spite of the promise of immunity
made to him, had fidgeted while sitting there
comfortably while his chums worked. “I can’t be
as mean as all that.”</p>

<p>“I thought not,” remarked Jerry, and then,
with the help of his fat chum, he soon had the
shoe off. The three made short work of changing
the tire; and a little later they were on their way
once more.</p>

<p>“There’s an eating place!” exclaimed Bob
eagerly, as they swung up toward a roadside
stand. “We got some dandy sandwiches there
once.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t forgotten it,” chuckled Ned.
“All right, I’ll stand treat. Slow up, Jerry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later the three were drinking cool
ginger ale and munching the bread and meat.</p>

<p>“I notice,” said Bob, as he casually took a bite,
“that you fellows are eating with about as good
an appetite as I have, in spite of the fun you
made.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I admit I was hungry,” said Ned, as he
held out his glass.</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Jerry. “It was working
on that tire, I guess.”</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when they neared Cresville
again, after swinging about in a ten-mile circle.
They had greatly enjoyed the little trip, and were
discussing whether or not they would take advantage
of the following Saturday for a motor
boat ride, or for a spin in their airship, since the
chums possessed both those means of locomotion.</p>

<p>“I vote for the airship,” said Bob. “We
don’t have to look out for punctures, and there’s
no danger of getting stuck as in a motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like the boat,” said Ned. “But if
you want the airship I’m willing. Noddy Nixon
is back in town, though, I hear, and if we start
flying he’s almost sure to do the same thing, and
generally he manages to camp on our trail, somehow.
But maybe we can shake him.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” put in Jerry Hopkins. “We’ll—Hello!”
he cried, suddenly interrupting himself,
as the car swung around a curve, and approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a railroad crossing. “What’s going on at the
depot?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There’s a crowd all right,” asserted Bob.</p>

<p>“An accident, I guess!” exclaimed Ned.
“The through train must have just passed along,
and hit someone! Put on speed, Jerry!”</p>

<p>The tall lad did so, and the car shot ahead.</p>

<p>“No, there doesn’t seem to be anybody hurt,”
spoke Bob. “I can’t see any ambulance. The
crowd seems to be watching two men who—by
Jinks! What <em>are</em> they doing?” he finished.</p>

<p>“I see ’em,” added Ned. “They seem to be
digging between the rails.”</p>

<p>“And yet they don’t look like section hands,”
spoke Jerry. “They seem more like Westerners.
Look at their big hats!”</p>

<p>“And red shirts,” remarked Bob. “Yet
they’re grubbing between the ties for all they’re
worth. That’s queer.”</p>

<p>“And see how excited the crowd is,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and look at Mr. Hitter, the freight
agent!” cried Jerry. “He’s hopping up and
down like a hen on a hot griddle. We must see
what’s going on!”</p>

<p>“Surest think you know!” agreed Bob.
“Maybe it’s a lawsuit against the railroad, and
they’re tearing up the tracks.”</p>

<p>With the boys eagerly looking ahead, the auto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
approached nearer the throng that surrounded
two men whose strange actions seemed to fascinate
those in the throng. Then Jerry uttered a
queer cry.</p>

<p>“Look!” he fairly shouted. “One of those
men is Jim Nestor, who is in charge of our mine
in Arizona! What can he be doing East? Fellows,
there’s something queer going on here!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A TOWN GONE MAD</small></h2>


<p>With a screech of the brakes, the auto came to
a stop not far from the throng that surrounded
the two men, who were still digging away with
sticks between the railroad tracks. The three
lads leaped out, wormed their way through the
press of persons, and, gaining a place where they
could get a better view, looked on in wonder.</p>

<p>“It’s Jim all right,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“Then he must have left our mine to shift for
itself,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s no good any more,” suggested
Ned. “Jim Nestor wouldn’t leave that gold mine
without some good reason.”</p>

<p>Ned had spoke louder than he intended, and
at his words one of the men looked up. A smile
illuminated his bronzed face, and he called out:</p>

<p>“By crickey! There are the boys!”</p>

<p>“Jim Nestor!” exclaimed Jerry. “What
brings you East? We thought you were at our
mine!”</p>

<p>“I just had to come!” replied he who answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to the name of Jim Nestor. “Boys, it’s a
queer story, but I’ve got something else on hand
just now—me and Harvey Brill here. I’ll be with
you in a few minutes, just as soon as we see how
far this lode goes,” and he began digging again
with his stick between the ties.</p>

<p>And now, may I beg your indulgence for just a
moment or two—you, my new readers—while I
explain a little bit about the three boys who are
to be the heroes of this story? Those of you who
have read the previous books in this series may
skip this part, as I know you will, but others may
care to know a little more about Bob Baker, Jerry
Hopkins and Ned Slade.</p>

<p>The three chums had lived for several years
in the New England town of Cresville. Bob was
the son of Mr. Andrew Baker, a rich banker;
Jerry the only son of a well-to-do widow—Mrs.
Julia Hopkins; while Ned’s father, Aaron Slade,
was a well-known department store proprietor.</p>

<p>The boys’ acquaintance began when they each
became possessed of bicycles, and went on trips together.
Then they got motor cycles, as related in
the first volume of the series, “The Motor Boys,”
and, winning a race, they got an auto as a prize.</p>

<p>In their car they went on a tour overland, with
a certain Professor Snodgrass, an enthusiastic collector
of bugs and insects for various colleges and
museums. The professor was quite a character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>After their tour overland, during which many
exciting incidents happened, the motor boys
traveled to Mexico, discovering a buried city, and
came home across the plains, on which trip they
discovered the hermit of Lost Lake.</p>

<p>About this time motor boating came much into
prominence, and our three heroes, of course, had
to have a water craft. How they got one, and
made many a trip in it, is told in the book, “The
Motor Boys Afloat.” Their voyage on the Atlantic
was filled with adventures of moment, and
when they went to the strange waters of the
Florida Everglades they had trials and troubles
as well as a good time.</p>

<p>Their journey to the Pacific enabled them to
locate a strange derelict, after considerable hardships.</p>

<p>It was to be expected, with the progress made
in navigating the air, that the motor boys would,
sooner or later, want a biplane, or some craft that
could take them above the earth. In the book
“The Motor Boys in the Clouds,” I related how
they went on a long trip for fame and fortune,
while later, when they went over the Rockies, they
solved a strange mystery of the air. Then they
traveled over the ocean and made a marvelous
rescue in mid-air.</p>

<p>Getting on the wing again, they sought the airship
treasure, and in the book that immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
precedes this one, called “The Motor Boys After
a Fortune,” I related how the three chums sought
to locate a quantity of radium, said to be deposited
in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. Incidentally
they located a hut on Snake Island, and
rescued a celebrated scientist.</p>

<p>The boys had not been back home very long
when the present story opens. I might add that
though the lads had many friends they had one or
two enemies, of whom Noddy Nixon, a rival airship
enthusiast, was one, together with his crony,
Bill Berry. Noddy and Bill never lost a chance
to do our friends a bad turn.</p>

<p>In one of their many adventures the boys had
met with Jim Nestor, an old miner and prospector,
and they had been able to help him locate a rich
gold mine in Arizona. The boys were given
shares in it for their help, and Mr. Nestor remained
out West to work the claim, sending the
boys their profits at intervals. It can well be
imagined how surprised the lads were when they
saw the old miner in their home town, engaged
in the curious occupation of digging in the dirt
between the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>“He must be crazy!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“What’s he up to, anyhow?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure, they’re both crazy!” declared a man in
the throng about the depot. “They got off the
through train a little while ago, and one of them—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
big fellow—right away started to dig in
the dirt with an old broom handle. Then the
other did the same thing, and they’ve been at it
ever since. Do you boys know ’em?”</p>

<p>“One of them—Jim Nestor—is the foreman
at a gold mine in which we have an interest,” said
Jerry. “The other I don’t know, except that Jim
said his name was Harvey Brill.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re both crazy,” said the man.</p>

<p>“That one chap may be—but not Jim Nestor,”
declared Jerry, with a positive shake of his head.
“Jim knows what he is doing, and I guess his
partner does, too.”</p>

<p>“But what are they doing?” asked the man.
“Have they lost something?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jerry. “But I’ll
soon find out. I’ll ask Jim——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a shout from the man
designated as Harvey Brill. He dropped his
stick, caught up a piece of rock, and cried:</p>

<p>“I knew it! You can’t fool me, Jim, when I
see pay dirt! I got a glimpse of it as soon as we
hopped off the steam cars. My eyes are good for
something yet. Look there!”</p>

<p>“That’s right. There’s the yellow stuff as sure
as you’re born!” agreed Jim Nestor, as he
critically examined the piece of rock his friend
held out to him. “But how in the world do you
reckon it ever got here—on the railroad track?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give it up, but it’s here all right. Now we’ll
have to get picks and shovels, a pan, a cradle maybe,
and wash out some of the gravel, and——”</p>

<p>“Say, do you fellows want to be killed?” yelled
Mr. Hitter, the freight, station and ticket agent,
as he pushed through the crowd and confronted
the two men. “Do you want to be run over?”</p>

<p>“Well, we ain’t just hankering after it,
stranger,” said Jim Nestor, slowly. “Were you
calculating on having us treated that way?”</p>

<p>“Why the down express is due in another
minute!” cried Mr. Hitter. “If you don’t get
off the track you’ll be run down! Get off I say!”</p>

<p>“Not just yet, son,” said Harvey Brill, calmly.
“This is too good a place to leave. If we’ve got
a minute I may turn up another bit of pay dirt.
It won’t take me a second to get out of the way
of the train, and that leaves me fifty-nine seconds
to dig in.”</p>

<p>“But you must get off the track!” insisted the
agent. “You can’t dig up the ballast that way.
The rails may spread and cause an accident. Get
out of the way! There’s the whistle of the
train!” and he rushed about, dancing up and
down, pushing the crowd off the rails. “Leave
the track alone!” he shouted. “I’ll call out the
police if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s right, Harvey,” said Jim Nestor,
slowly. “We had better postpone our operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a while. Besides, I want to introduce you to the
friends of mine we came East to see.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jim, I’m agreeable,” assented the
other, as he picked up some more bits of rock.
“But I sure do hate to leave this pay dirt.”</p>

<p>“Jim—Jim Nestor!” cried Jerry. “What’s it
all about, anyhow? Why are you here? What
are you digging on the tracks for?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you soon, Jerry,” said the old miner.
“We came East on purpose to see you, and just
by accident we happened to see signs of gold in
the track ballast here. Of course it——”</p>

<p>“Gold!” cried half a dozen in the throng.</p>

<p>“Sure, gold!” put in Harvey Brill. “You
can’t fool me on the yellow stuff,” and he held out
his hand in which several yellow particles gleamed
dully.</p>

<p>“Gold! Gold!” murmured the crowd,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Come on! Tell us about it!” urged
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve got our car here,” added Jerry.
“Come on to my house, Jim, and give us the
story.”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” assented the mine foreman.
“Harvey, let me make you acquainted with three
of the liveliest boys in the United States,” and he
presented Jerry, Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you,” spoke Mr. Brill. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
sort of hate to leave these diggings,” and he
glanced back at the tracks; “but if there’s a
train coming I s’pose I’ve got to. But I can come
back. It’s as pretty a bit of pay dirt as I’ve seen
in some time. Now where’s the gasoline gig?”</p>

<p>“This way,” spoke Jerry, leading his chums
and friends through the throng. Mr. Hitter was
having trouble. The crowd pressed across the
tracks, eager to look at the place where the two
miners had been digging.</p>

<p>“Get back! Get back!” cried the agent.
“The express is coming!”</p>

<p>He fairly thrust the curious ones off the track
as the whistle of the approaching train was
heard. Into the auto hurried the boys and their
friends and, forbearing to question Mr. Nestor
and his acquaintance on the road, Jerry and his
chums soon had them at his house.</p>

<p>“Now tell us all about it!” urged the tall lad.
“Why are you here, Jim; and what do you want
us to do?”</p>

<p>“What do I want you to do?” repeated Jim,
slowly. “Well, I’ll tell you. I want you to help
my friend here—Harvey Brill—recover sixty
nuggets of gold.”</p>

<p>“Sixty nuggets of gold?” repeated the motor
boys, in a chorus.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Mr. Brill, calmly. “Sixty
nuggets, and all of ’em fairly big ones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are they on the railroad track?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“No, son, they’re in the hardest valley to get
to that I ever saw,” replied the old miser; “and
they’re the prettiest nuggets I ever met up with.
Sixty of ’em, and they’re on the border between
Montana and Canada. I need help to get ’em
back again, and Jim here suggested you boys.
If you’d like to have a try, and go through some
of the wildest country you ever saw, why——”</p>

<p>But Mr. Brill was interrupted by a cry from
without. There was a pounding of feet on the
porch of the Hopkins home, and a shrill voice
yelled:</p>

<p>“Hey, fellows—Bob—Jerry—Ned!—Come
on out—big excitement—whole town gone gold-crazy—they’re
tearing up the railroad tracks—going
to order out the militia—blow up the place
with dynamite—people gone wild—taking up
the ties—looking for nuggets—Hitter is dancing
up and down—he’s sent for the railroad president
in a special train—come on—lots of fun—it’s
great—let’s get some—come on!”</p>

<p>A silence followed, broken only by the rapid
breathing of someone just outside the long windows
of the library, opening on the porch, near
which the motor boys and their friends sat.</p>

<p>“What’s that—a phonograph broke loose?”
asked Mr. Brill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess it’s Andy Rush,” said Jerry, laughing.
“That’s the way he always talks.”</p>

<p>“Well, he wants to look out or he’ll bust!”
said the man who had spoken of the sixty nuggets
of gold. “I never heard such rapid-fire conversation.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” burst out Andy. “Everybody’s
going—they’re wild—tearing up the tracks!”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he means?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” replied Bob. “It’s just some of
his nonsense I guess.”</p>

<p>“No—look!” cried Jerry, pointing through
the window at several men and boys, with picks
and shovels over their shoulders, hurrying toward
the railroad. At the same time, from the
direction of the station, which was not far from
Jerry’s house, could be heard a murmur of many
voices.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried Ned. “Andy is right!
The whole town has gone gold-crazy! Come
on, fellows!” and he fairly leaped through the
long window.</p>

<small>DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p>Ned’s chums were not long in following him,
nor were the two Westerners far behind. Mrs.
Hopkins, who had seen her son and his friends
come in, wondered much at their sudden departure,
with the excitable Andy Rush leading the
procession.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just know something is going to happen!”
exclaimed the widow. “I’m sure those
boys are planning another of their wild trips.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” said a friend who had
called. “I’m sure it seems to do them good.
But I wonder what it is this time?”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Jerry’s mother.</p>

<p>In fact the motor boys themselves wondered
much why Mr. Nestor had come East, bringing
the friend who spoke so mysteriously of the sixty
nuggets of gold. But there was no time now to
question them, for the present excitement drove
all other thoughts from their minds.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it, Andy?” questioned
Jerry, as he raced along beside his small
acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not much—I was coming from the store—I
had to get a loaf of bread and some——”</p>

<p>“Skip all that,” interrupted Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I saw a crowd at the railroad—big
mob—all yelling—digging at the tracks—some
said gold—they want to take up the rails—pull
out the ties—move the cars off the tracks—Hitter
is wild—he wants the militia——”</p>

<p>Andy had to stop for breath. The boys could
hear the excitement as they came nearer the
depot. It was evident that the excitable little
chap was more than half right.</p>

<p>“Look at the crowd!” yelled Bob. “I should
say they <em>were</em> crazy!”</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I expect we’re to blame,” replied Mr. Nestor.
“We started a gold rush, Harvey.”</p>

<p>“Is there really gold there?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“There sure is,” declared Mr. Brill. “You
can’t fool me on the yellow stuff.”</p>

<p>“We just had a glimpse of it as we got off the
train to come and see you,” explained Jim.
“Nothing would do Harvey but he must prospect
a bit, and we did—with broom handles we picked
up.”</p>

<p>“And the gold was there,” declared his friend.
“But it isn’t much that I got, though I’m going
to look for more.”</p>

<p>By this time they were close to the crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Truly it was a frenzied throng. Men and boys
were eagerly digging at the cinders and stone
ballast between the rails and ties. Some had
picks and shovels and others merely sticks, but
one and all were tossing out the dirt, and eagerly
looking for traces of gold.</p>

<p>“Here! Here! You’ve got to stop this!”
cried the agent. “You’ll have the rails all loose,
and the trains will run off the tracks. Oh, won’t
somebody get the police? Send in a riot call! I
want the militia! I’m going to wire the Governor
for troops! I’ve sent for the directors of the
railroad! This is awful!” and Mr. Hitter raced
up and down the track.</p>

<p>Occasionally he would thrust aside some enthusiastic
digger, who seemed to be undermining
the rails, but this one’s place was immediately
taken by another. Up and down the tracks, for
some distance, men and boys, and even some
girls, were digging away furiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is awful!” groaned Mr. Hitter.
“The road will be ruined!”</p>

<p>“Not if there’s gold here!” exclaimed one
man. “If the tracks are over a mine they can
be moved. Better get a shovel, Hitter, and help
yourself.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy!” shouted the agent. “There
is no gold here!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is! Those fellows found some!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
declared the man, pointing at Mr. Nestor and his
friend.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all your fault!” cried the agent, addressing
the motor boys and their friends. “You
started this wild panic. Tell them there is no
gold here!”</p>

<p>“But there <em>is</em> some!” insisted Mr. Brill, taking
the yellow grains from his pocket. This
seemed to make the crowd wilder than ever, and
they pushed and shoved to get to the very place
where the miner had found the golden particles.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll all be killed!” cried the agent.
“Here comes the other fast express! Get out
of the way!” he yelled.</p>

<p>The crowd did not seem to hear him, and Jerry
and his chums were beginning to get alarmed,
when there was a rush from the other side of the
track, and several officers, led by the chief of
police, dashed up.</p>

<p>“Oh, Chief!” cried Mr. Hitter. “This is
terrible! There won’t be any railroad left, soon.
Make ’em get back!” and he quickly told of the
trouble, and explained about the coming train.</p>

<p>The chief acted without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Come, men!” he cried. “Get back or I’ll
arrest you. Officers, draw your clubs!” he cried
sternly. “Use ’em if these persons don’t get off
the track. You’re trespassing!” he added.
“Get back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>He emphasized his words by shoving away
those nearest to him.</p>

<p>“Lend a hand here!” the chief called to the
motor boys.</p>

<p>“Come on!” yelled Jerry. “It’s partly our
fault. Get ’em back out of the way of the
train!”</p>

<p>The two Westerners lent their aid, and, much
against their will, the mob got out of the path
of the train, which whizzed past a moment later.
The agent breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Many of the crowd had pieces of stone in
which they detected yellow gleams. Others had
hats or bags full of gravel.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have this tested at a jewelry
store!” cried one man, as he rushed off up the
street. His example was followed by others,
and soon nearly half the crowd had started on a
rush for the jeweler’s.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d all go,” said the freight agent.
“Can’t you keep ’em off the track, Chief?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, but it’s all foolishness anyhow.
There’s no gold here.”</p>

<p>“There is!” asserted Mr. Brill. “I found
some,” and he exhibited the yellow grains.</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any more,” declared Mr.
Hitter. “I know there isn’t. How can there be
gold where none was ever found before—and in
railroad ballast at that? Oh, if you don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to see all the tracks torn up, tell these crazy folks
that there’s no more gold here!” implored the
agent.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take a look and see,” agreed Mr.
Brill. “And I’m free to confess I don’t see how
this gold got here anyhow. Certainly it isn’t the
place for it, though some gold quartz might have
gotten in the railroad ballast. But I’ll take a
look. Come on, Jim. You know pay dirt better
than I do.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the mine foreman. The
crowd suspended operations while the two made
a careful investigation, not only in the place
where the first particles had been found, but for
some distance up and down the track. While
they were doing this, loud voices were heard off
to one side of the track.</p>

<p>“Let me past!” demanded someone. “Shove
’em out of the way, Bill. We’ve got as good a
right to this gold as any one!”</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Bill Berry is with him,” added
Bob.</p>

<p>“They’ve got a wheelbarrow,” said Ned.</p>

<p>It was true. The town bully and his crony,
having heard the wild rumors of the gold
“strike,” had come with shovels and a barrow to
carry away as much as they could of the track
ballast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here! You stop that!” yelled Mr. Hitter,
as he saw Noddy and Bill shoveling heaps of rock
and cinders into the barrow. “You can’t do
that—you’ll ruin the roadbed!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let him bother us, Bill,” advised
Noddy. “My father owns stock in this road,
and I have as good a right to this gold as anybody.”</p>

<p>He went on shoveling. Mr. Hitter raced up
and down, calling for help, but no one paid much
attention to him. All eyes were centered on the
two miners. They made a careful examination,
and then Jim Nestor announced:</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added his friend. “It’s
streaked out!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the throng about them.</p>

<p>“No more gold,” announced Jim. “It was
just in that one spot, and it wasn’t much at that.
Not more than a few dollars worth. Your road
is safe, stranger,” and he nodded to Mr.
Hitter.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” ejaculated the agent.</p>

<p>“But how did any gold get there?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Mr. Brill. “Some of
the ballast might have been loaded in a car that
had been out in the mining region, and some
quartz might have got stuck in a crack, to fall out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
when they unloaded here. But that’s all the gold
there is in these diggings,” and once more he
looked at the particles he possessed.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried a fussy old gentleman,
who had just come up, having only a few minutes
before heard of the odd discovery. “You found
gold, and think it came from quartz?”</p>

<p>“That’s my theory,” said Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>“Let me look at what you found,” said the old
gentleman, and the miner did so. The old gentleman
chuckled. Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, I never. If this isn’t odd!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why this is gold all right, but it isn’t from
any gold quartz. It’s from my gold watch. It
fell out of my pocket as I got off the train the
other day, and rolled on the track. Before I
could rescue it the train started and rolled over
it. It was caught on the rails and ground to
pieces, and some particles fell in the ballast.
That’s where your gold is from. I was in a
hurry at the time, and as the watch was not a very
valuable one I did not report it to Mr. Hitter,
but went off home. I just returned from a trip,
and I heard about this excitement. But that gold
is from my watch as sure as anything. I recognize
a small piece that had my initials on it—see,” and
he showed a bit of engraving.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jim Nestor, slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sure is,” assented his partner. “The
gold strike has fizzled out.”</p>

<p>There was a groan of disappointment from the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Stung!” cried one discouraged youth.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Jerry, as he pointed to Noddy
Nixon and Bill Berry, wheeling away a big barrow
full of ballast, with Mr. Hitter racing wildly
after them.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” advised the old gentleman.
“He won’t come back after he has that assayed,”
and he chuckled.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” agreed Mr. Nestor.</p>

<p>“I hope the sixty nuggets don’t turn out that
way,” said Ned, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Indeed they won’t!” exclaimed Mr. Brill.
“I’m sorry I caused such a rumpus, but I didn’t
mean to. I saw the gleam of gold as I got off
the train, and it always excites me. But those
sixty nuggets—they’re as real as heart could wish.
Now if you boys want to hear the yarn, I’m ready
to tell you, seeing that this excitement has petered
out.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we do,” said Jerry, as he led the way
out of the crowd.</p>

<p>“And we’ll help you recover the gold, too,”
added Bob.</p>

<p>“Indeed we will,” came from Ned. “We
were just wishing for some excitement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you’ll get it all right,” was Mr.
Nestor’s opinion. “You’ll get it if you reach the
border with us and have a hunt for those sixty
nuggets of gold. Come on, Harvey, and spin your
yarn. I reckoned as how these lads would help
us,” and as they once more approached Jerry’s
house, while the disappointed crowd filed away
from the railroad, they had a glimpse of Noddy
Nixon and Bill Berry hurrying with their barrow
of track ballast to the nearest jewelry store.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION</small></h2>


<p>“Say, fellows, it would be worth while going to
see how he takes it,” remarked Ned, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>“How who takes it?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“And takes what?—explanation yourself,” put
in Bob, as the three chums, and their two Western
friends, paused at Jerry’s front gate. “Who
are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon,” went on Ned, laughing as he
gazed down the road where the bully and his
crony could still be seen trundling his barrow of
dirt. “I’d like to be at the jewelry store when
Noddy hears that what he has isn’t worth a hill
of beans,” added Ned. “For of course he’s going
to have it assayed. Let’s go watch him.”</p>

<p>Ned seemed as if about to start after Noddy,
but Jerry, putting out a quick hand, pulled him
back.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” exclaimed the tall lad. “It
might be some sport to see what a fuss Noddy’ll
put up when he finds out he’s been fooled, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
would only be a passing joke, and, if he saw us
standing around, laughing at him, he’d get mad
and raise a row. Now we don’t want that. We
haven’t had a run-in with him in some time, and
there’s no use looking for trouble. Let’s pass it.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on Bob, “we want to hear
about the sixty nuggets of gold. There’s more interest
in listening to a yarn about real gold than
in seeing Noddy get fooled over something that
isn’t gold; eh, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you’re both against me, of course
I’ll have to give in,” sighed Ned; “but I sure
would like to see the look on Noddy’s and Bill’s
faces when they hear that they’ve been stung.
They don’t realize it yet, for they were some distance
off when the old gentleman explained about
it being his watch that caused the lode of gold.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” put in Mr. Brill. “Curious
how I got fooled myself that same way. But at
least I knew it was gold, and I was so surprised
at finding it in that place that I never stopped to
look at the character of it.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” chimed in Jim Nestor. “But if
you boys want to hear the story I guess Harvey
is ready to tell it, and then, if you’re agreeable,
we’ll start after the sixty nuggets of gold.”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” yelled Bob. “That’s great! Off
for the border and the golden West!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Jerry, placing his hand on
his chum’s arm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the stout lad,
looking around.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use informing the whole
town about what we may do,” went on Jerry, in
a low voice. “Besides——” He paused suddenly,
and continued—“well, let’s go in and talk
it over.”</p>

<p>“Say, there was some other reason why you
stopped me,” spoke Bob, as he and the tall lad
dropped back of the others. “What was it,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t want to mention it before the
others, but, just as you spoke, I saw Sim Fletcher
walking around the corner, and I’m almost sure
he heard what we were talking about.”</p>

<p>“Sim Fletcher—that chap who’s been hanging
around with Bill Berry lately?”</p>

<p>“That’s the one.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you stopped me, then, for I
shouldn’t want Sim to know any of our business
any more than I would Bill Berry, or Noddy
Nixon. But I guess it’s all right so far; isn’t
it? I didn’t let out much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I don’t believe any harm was done,”
said Jerry, but, at the same time he looked closely
in the direction where Sim Fletcher had been last
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, boys,” began Jim Nestor, when they
were all once more seated in the parlor of Jerry’s
home, “I guess we can spin the yarn now without
being interrupted by that fellow who talks like
a phonograph going at full speed. Are you all
ready?”</p>

<p>“We sure are!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, then, in the first place,” went on the
Westerner, with a glance at Harvey Brill, who
sat staring about the well-furnished room; “in the
first place let me say that I left your mine in good
hands. It’s producing well, and the ore is just
as high grade as ever. But I simply couldn’t stay
there after Harvey told me his story. So I engaged
a friend of mine—Jake Masterford—to
look after things while I was away—and I know
Jake’ll do it as well as I could. So you needn’t
worry about the mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we aren’t worrying,” said Jerry. “Only
it rather surprised us to see you here East, when
we thought you were in Arizona.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you a bit,” spoke Jim. “And
I’ll tell you how it happened. One afternoon,
following a fine clean-up, and when I had the gold
safely put away and was wondering what I’d have
for supper, there come a cloud of dust up the
trail, and I thinks to myself here’s someone in a
hurry. I unlimbered my shooting iron, having
some notion it might be a raid, and I was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
going to call to the boys to get ready when I seen
it was only one man. Then I knew it was all right,
but I was sure some surprised when I recognized
my old side partner, Harvey Brill, with whom I
used to prospect years ago. I seen Harvey was
some excited, and I was, too, when he told me
his yarn.</p>

<p>“And here’s where I relinquish the stage and
spot light to him,” went on the mine foreman;
“them being the proper terms, as I understand
’em. Now, Harvey, spin your yarn.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take long,” said the man who had
brought the news of the sixty nuggets of gold.
“To begin with, I’m a miner and prospector, and
have been ever since I was able to handle a pick
and shovel.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I ever had much luck until
lately, and then I sure did strike it rich. I’d gone
to Helena, Montana, with a party of other prospectors,
and we got so low that we had to be
grub-staked. Even that didn’t pan out, and then
I cut loose from the others and struck off to the
northwest, in the mountains.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you all the trouble I had, nor
what I suffered before I made my strike, as it
hasn’t much to do with the story. But one afternoon,
when I was plumb discouraged, I happened
to dig my pick in a certain place, and when I
turned out a stone I saw the yellow gleam. I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
it was gold at once, and I went at the spot like a
dog after a rabbit.</p>

<p>“Again, to shorten things up, I kept on digging
until I turned out just sixty nuggets of gold—some
of good size, and some small, but the lot was
easily worth twenty thousand dollars—maybe
more.”</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand dollars!” gasped Jerry.</p>

<p>“Whew!” echoed Bob and Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” resumed the miner. “Sixty
nuggets of almost pure gold I found.”</p>

<p>“And where are they now?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, son,” said the miner.
“They’re hid in a place that I don’t know as
we’ll be able to get ’em out of or not.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Jerry wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because I hid em down in a deep valley, right
on the border line between Montana and Canada.
It’s the hardest valley to get into and out of that
I ever saw. There’s only one trail that I know of,
and when I came back on it, after hiding my
wealth, a landslide started and I don’t know as
anyone will ever be able to get down into the valley
again.”</p>

<p>Bob murmured something that sounded like
“airship.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Mr. Brill. “An airship?
Well I never——”</p>

<p>“I told you these boys had an airship,” interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Jim Nestor. “If that valley’s on top
of the ground they can get to it. But go on, let
that part go for now. Tell ’em the rest of the
story, and why you hid the gold.”</p>

<p>“I’ll shorten it a bit,” resumed the prospector.
“As soon as I had my nuggets, I found out that I
was being watched and trailed by some of the
grub-stakers I had cut loose from. They were after
me, and as they were desperate men I realized
that they would rob me if I started away with the
nuggets. That’s why I hid my gold.”</p>

<p>“But why couldn’t you get a posse—have the
sheriff and some of his deputies protect you?”
asked Jerry, who thought the man’s explanation
a bit queer.</p>

<p>“Well, son, I s’pose I could have done that,”
said Mr. Brill, slowly; “but I tell you—I’m a
peculiar man, and for some years back a host of
poor relations have been depending on me to support
’em. I’m about tired of it, and now that I
have struck it rich, if they heard about it, I’d
never have any peace. They’d all want to come
and live with me, and my sixty nuggets wouldn’t
last long with that crowd. So that’s why I don’t
want much of a fuss when I go to claim ’em. I
want to dig ’em up nice and quiet like, and enjoy
my wealth myself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“But couldn’t you have waited until these grub-stakers
had gotten out of the way, and then dug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
up your gold, and got away with it?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Son, you don’t know those fellows!” exclaimed
the miner. “They’ll hang around that
locality for more’n a year waiting for me to come
back and give ’em a clew. It won’t do. They’re
too sharp. I had to come away without the
nuggets, and now we’ve got to fool ’em, and get
that gold when they don’t know it. Besides, it’s
going to be some job to get into that valley I
reckon, even with an airship, though I never saw
one of the contraptions.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can manage that part of it,” said
Jerry with a smile, as he thought of their fine
craft of the clouds. “But what happened when
you found you were in danger of being robbed?”</p>

<p>“What happened? Why, I made up my mind
I needed help, and I at once set out to hike it to
my friend Jim Nestor. I knew where he was,
having had a letter from him. I knew he could
advise me. So I left the sixty nuggets of gold
hidden near the border, and went for him. Then
he——”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the rest,” interrupted Jim, with a
grin. “As soon as I heard Harvey’s story,” the
foreman resumed; “I thought of you motor boys
at once. ‘They’re the chaps for us,’ I said.
‘Let’s go East,’ and East we came and here we
are. Now do you boys want to have a try for
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do we?” cried the three in a chorus, while
Jerry added: “We sure do!”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” cried Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“But do you think you can find this valley
again?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can,” said Mr. Brill. “It isn’t easy
to locate, but there’s one curious thing about it
that I never saw anywhere else, and that is there
are a curious kind of luminous snakes in it—snakes
that shine at night. I never——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” suddenly interrupted a voice
at the parlor door. “Luminous snakes? Snakes
that glow with phosphorus? Do you mean
that? Oh, my dear man, let me ask you to be
careful! Do not, I beg you, do not disappoint
me! Luminous snakes! Oh, is the ambition of
my life to be realized?” and there rushed into
the room a little man, with a very bald head, and
a pair of very large spectacles over his bright
eyes. He strode up to Mr. Brill, and grasped him
by the arm.</p>

<p>“Say that again!” the little man implored.
“Tell me about the luminous snakes!”</p>

<p>“Wha—what—who are you?” asked the
miner, shrinking back as though he feared a
lunatic had attacked him.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” exclaimed Jerry.
“We might know he’d be on hand when a new
kind of bug or reptile was mentioned!”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass continued to gaze steadfastly
at the astonished miner, still keeping hold
of his coat. Then over the face of the little bald-headed
scientist there came a change. Into his
eyes there shot a gleam of joy.</p>

<p>“Stand still!” he commanded, though Mr.
Brill was too much startled to do anything in the
line of motion. “Don’t stir!” went on the professor.
“I’ll have him in a minute. It’s on your
neck! Oh, if only it doesn’t hop off! Easy now!
There! I have it!” and with a quick motion he
removed some insect from the coat collar of the
miner. The latter moved quickly back and
seemed about to bolt from the room.</p>

<p>“Wha—what am I up against?” he asked.
“Is he crazy—or am I? What is he after, anyhow?
Have I got bugs on me?”</p>

<p>“You did have, my dear man,” said the professor,
calmly, as he took out a small box, with
a glass top, under which he imprisoned his prize.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
“You were carrying about with you a very rare
specimen of a jumping fly—something I have
been hoping to capture for years. Now I have
the little beauty. Oh, you can’t get away!” he
added, as the insect leaped against the glass. “I
have you safe.”</p>

<p>“Is—er—am I—what’s it all about, anyhow?”
cried the miner, looking from one to the
other.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Harvey—it’s all right,” said Jim
Nestor soothingly, for he knew the professor of
old. “Mr. Snodgrass collects bugs and things for
scientific purposes. He just found one on you,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“A jumping fly—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excilio muscarium</i>—it might
be Latinized,” explained the scientist. “A very
rare specimen. I am exceedingly obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh—Oh, you—you’re welcome,” stammered
Mr. Brill. “I hope I haven’t any more things on
me,” and he looked himself over as well as he
could.</p>

<p>“No more,” said the professor, aiding in the
search. “I wish you had. But what is this I
heard about the luminous snakes?” he asked.
“Snakes that shine at night—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illustris serpensus</i> as
they could be called. Many years have I longed
to get such a specimen, and now, unexpectedly, I
get on the track.</p>

<p>“I might explain,” he went on, turning to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
boys, “that I have been sent out by a Boston
museum to look for a new kind of blue lizard, but
I can combine my search for that with the
luminous snakes—the latter being much more
valuable. I came to Cresville, thinking perhaps
you boys might be going off on some expedition,
as you frequently are, and I proposed to join you
to look for the blue lizard. I came directly to
your house, Jerry, since your mother has been so
kind as to give me a standing invitation, and, just
as I enter I hear—‘luminous snakes!’ Oh, how
I rejoiced! This has indeed been a fortunate day
for me!” and he looked at the jumping fly in his
little box.</p>

<p>Mr. Brill was less excited now, since Jim
Nestor had, in a whisper, explained more about
the talented and kind professor, whose only hobby
was bugs and reptiles.</p>

<p>“Tell me more about the snakes,” urged the
scientist.</p>

<p>“They were only casually mentioned,” said
Jerry, and briefly he related what is already
known to my readers about the visit East of the
two Westerners, and the curious train of events
that had followed.</p>

<p>“And are you going after the sixty nuggets
of gold?” asked the professor, eagerly.</p>

<p>“We hope to,” spoke Bob, while the chums
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then may I go along to look for the
luminous serpents?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” exclaimed Jerry. “But we’ll
have to put this up to the folks,” he added to his
chums. “I hope my mother will let us go,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure my folks won’t object,” said
Bob, while Ned nodded to show that he, too,
thought he could easily gain the necessary consent.</p>

<p>“Then the thing to do is to tell them about
it,” went on Jerry. “Professor, you know
where your room is—the same one you always
have. Jim, I’m going to put you and Mr. Brill
up here, and maybe——”</p>

<p>“We were calculating on going to a hotel,”
said the mine foreman. “We’re not exactly
used to plush carpets on the floor, and all that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh shucks!” exclaimed Jerry. “You’ll
stay here. Besides, I think the hotel is over-crowded,
anyhow. We’ve got lots of room. I’ll
bring mother in and introduce you to her, and
then we’ll leave you for a while. Dinner will
soon be ready.”</p>

<p>“Dinner!” exclaimed Mr. Brill. “Why it’s
long past noon. Besides we had a snack on the
train—me and Jim.”</p>

<p>“We call supper dinner here,” explained Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with a laugh. “There’s no sense in it, as far as I
can see, but we always have dinner at night.”</p>

<p>“And breakfast at noon?” asked Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>“No, that goes by its regular name, but the
noon meal is lunch, here in the East.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what they call ’em, as long as
there’s something to eat,” said Bob, with a sigh,
at which they all laughed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins came in, and soon made the
two miners feel at home. They were shown to
their rooms, and the professor to his.</p>

<p>“Well, Jerry, what is it this time?” asked his
mother, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Sixty nuggets of gold, and some luminous
snakes!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, what boys!” cried Mrs. Hopkins.
“There, I’m not going to listen to a thing about
it now. I’ve got to see about dinner.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll talk it over at the table,” proposed
Jerry, as his mother hurried away to look
to the comfort of her unexpected guests. “For
we’re bound to go.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows, I’ll tell you what we’ll do,”
suggested Jerry. “We’ll go to the station and
get the baggage of the two miners, and then it
will be nearly dinner time. My! how this day has
passed! Come on, we’ll run down in the car.”</p>

<p>As they were about to enter it there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
rush of feet down the street, and a shrill voice
burst out with:</p>

<p>“You’d better look out—he’s awful mad—says
he’s going to fix you—blow up the place—have
you arrested—sent to jail—he’s raving—completely
fooled—you’ll soon see him—Oh my!
wow!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now, Andy?” asked
Jerry, turning to see the little chap panting from
a run, and from his flow of words. “Is it a
mad dog, or a runaway horse?”</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy Nixon!” gasped Andy. “He—he——”
but words failed him, and he could only
make motions with his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, Noddy!” exclaimed Jerry. “Here,
Andy, hop in and we’ll see if we can’t catch your
breath for you,” and he cranked the car while
the others took their seats.</p>

<p>They had not progressed far down the street
before, near the jewelry store toward which he
had gone, they saw Noddy Nixon. Beside him
was Bill Berry, wheeling a barrow load of dirt,
and the looks on the faces of the two showed
anger and disappointment.</p>

<p>“Slow up, Jerry,” said Ned, in a low voice,
and the tall lad did so.</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon, catching sight of them, said
something to Bill, who stopped. Then the bully,
shaking his fist at the three chums, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll fix you for this, all right!”</p>

<p>“Fix us for what?” asked Jerry, innocently.</p>

<p>“For playing that trick on me. You knew
there wasn’t any gold there, but you pretended
there was, and I dug up a whole lot of worthless
dirt. Bah! I’ll fix you for it!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there any gold in your dirt,
Noddy?” asked Ned, smiling.</p>

<p>“No, and you know there wasn’t!” snapped
the bully. “You made me and Bill do a lot of
work for nothing. But I’ll get square with you,
and those two men. I know Jim Nestor—I’ll
fix you!”</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried Jerry, not willing to take
any more abuse. “We had no more to do with
your digging up the railroad track than the man
in the moon. You fooled yourself. There was
gold on the track, but it came from a watch that
was run over. We didn’t know it until a little
while ago. If you’re so foolish as to cart off
cinders, and think they’re gold, that’s not our
fault.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right! I’ll fix you!” growled
Noddy. “Go on, Bill. I don’t want to talk to
’em, but I’ll get square, somehow!”</p>

<p>“Be careful it isn’t in the same way when you
took the <i>Comet</i>—our airship—and had to walk
home,” warned Ned, referring to something that
had happened when the motor boys went after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
fortune of radium in the Grand Canyon. Noddy
and his cronies had overreached themselves that
time; but even then, Jerry and his chums had
saved the bully from the hut on Snake Island.</p>

<p>“That’s all right—I’ll fix you!” threatened
Noddy. “Come on, Bill.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you take for that load of dirt?”
taunted Bob, but Noddy did not answer.</p>

<p>“Better let him alone,” advised Jerry, as he
started the auto again.</p>

<p>“Think he’ll make trouble?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, he might try.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Andy Rush. “He
was fooled all right. I was at the jewelry store
when he took the dirt in. He said it was full of
gold, and he asked the clerk how much he’d give
for it. ‘Get out of here with that trash!’ the
clerk yelled, and when Noddy spilled a lot of it
on the floor, and on a lady’s dress, Mr. Smith,
the proprietor, was so mad that he shoved
Noddy and Bill out. Then Noddy fairly raved
and I ran to tell you. I thought he might do you
some harm.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Jerry, to the little chap.
“I guess we can handle Noddy,” and yet Jerry
felt a vague uneasiness as he thought of the sixty
nuggets of gold, and recalled that Sim Fletcher
might have overheard something about them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>FORMING THE SYNDICATE</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I guess they’ll come to a decision to-day,”
remarked Bob Baker, as he tilted back in
his chair, and looked across at his two chums,
Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” said Jerry. “For if
we go after that gold we’ll want some time to
prepare, and get the airship in shape.”</p>

<p>“Are you going in the <i>Comet</i>?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No—at least not all the way there. That’s
as far as I figured out. Of course we could
make the whole trip in her if we wanted to, but
I thought it would be better to ship her to—say
Kabspell, put her together there, and then all
get in and have a try for the valley of gold.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be a bad scheme,” agreed
Bob. “We could travel by railroad, I suppose,
and if they have dining cars on the train——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you and your dining cars!” cried Ned.
“Wouldn’t you get enough to eat if we took the
airship?”</p>

<p>“Well, I might, but I have to do most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cooking, and then, it’s rather cramped. You
can’t really enjoy a full meal on board.”</p>

<p>“And Bob always wants a full meal,” laughed
Jerry.</p>

<p>It was several days after the arrival of the
miners, and the time had passed quickly. The
chums had assembled at Bob’s house to talk matters
over, and, in fact, they had talked about
little else than the sixty nuggets of gold ever
since hearing of them.</p>

<p>Jim Nestor and Harvey Brill had been made
comfortable at the Hopkins home, as had Professor
Snodgrass. The latter at once began roving
about, as he always did, looking for new and
strange insects, while the two Westerners went
about town, Jim to call on some friends he had
made during a previous visit.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve put it up to the folks now, as to
whether we can go or not,” went on Ned.</p>

<p>“And they promised to have an answer for us
to-night,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“But I wonder why they wanted to have a
conference with Jim and his friend again?” inquired
Bob. “That’s twice they’ve held secret
meetings when they didn’t let us in. Can it be
that this thing isn’t going to pan out?” It was
a fact that, following the information given them
by their sons, Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. Slade and
Mr. Baker had been in frequent communication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and had been closeted with the two Westerners.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it’s all right,” said Jerry.
“There’s no fake about Harvey Brill; anyone
could tell that. And as for Jim Nestor, we all
know him. But I guess the folks think it’s a bit
dangerous, on account of those plotting grub-stakers,
and they want to see if there isn’t some
safer way to get the gold.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope they let us go,” spoke Bob,
with a sigh. “I always get such a good appetite
when I travel!”</p>

<p>“Hit him, Ned!” begged Jerry; but the stout
lad quickly got out of reach.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” remarked Jerry, after a
bit. “Let’s go down to the river, and look over
the motor boat. I promised Jim and his friend a
ride in it, and we’ve got time before dinner.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed his chums; and soon they
were tinkering at the motor, which needed some
slight adjustments.</p>

<p>“I say though,” questioned Bob, as he paused
with a bit of oily waste in his hand; “if we do
go, what about school? The term doesn’t end
for three or four weeks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can easily cut it, and make it up in
the Fall,” said Ned, quickly. “Besides, if we
want to, we can get Professor Snodgrass to coach
us.”</p>

<p>“Not if he gets on the trail of the luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
snakes,” declared Jerry, with a laugh. “He’ll
want to hunt for them all the while, for Mr.
Brill said he didn’t see very many—just a few
in the valley—and they may take all the professor’s
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can take a chance,” said Ned.
“Say, Bob, wipe that smudge off your nose.”</p>

<p>“I will. Thanks! There’s one on your ear.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can clean up,” announced Jerry.
“She’ll do.”</p>

<p>They returned to Bob’s house, and a little later
the whole party, including Mrs. Hopkins, Mr.
Slade, Mr. Baker, and the two Westerners, were
gathered about the table.</p>

<p>“I guess we can go, all right,” whispered Ned.
“Dad looks as though he’d consented.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” answered Jerry, for the grown
folk had been in conference with the miners just
prior to the announcement of the meal.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Mr. Slade, after a pause,
“I don’t see the necessity of keeping you in suspense
any longer. We have decided that——”</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Can we go?” burst out Ned.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_52">“CAN WE GO?” BURST OUT NED.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Wait a bit, son,” advised his father.
“There are one or two matters to be explained.
You did not hear, did you, that your friend Mr.
Brill expects to buy a valuable piece of mining
property near the one you are interested in, out
in Arizona?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, he didn’t tell us,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well it’s true,” said the prospector. “I
didn’t mention it because I had so much else on
my mind. But I got a chance to secure an
option on a mine not far from yours. I can get
it cheap, for the owners are getting discouraged
about it, but Jim and I figured on a new way to
handle the ore. But I’m afraid, unless I can
locate my sixty nuggets of gold, that I’ll have to
let the proposition go.”</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Because I haven’t the money to take it up.
I paid out two hundred dollars—nearly all the
money I had in the world except my sixty
nuggets—for a mere chance to buy an option inside
of a month.</p>

<p>“The option itself will cost me ten thousand
dollars, and if I get that it means that I have the
right, within another month, to buy the mine for
forty thousand dollars. Now I can swing half
of that, for my nuggets are easily worth twenty
thousand.”</p>

<p>“And I promised to take the other half interest,”
said Jim. “But just at present my
money is all tied up, and so I can’t advance
Harvey the necessary ten thousand to get the
option.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t close, and take that option in
a few days, I’ll lose the mine,” went on Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Brill. “And I hate to do that for I know it will
pay. I did think I could get to my nuggets in
time, but now I see I can’t, and so I guess the
mine will have to go to somebody else.”</p>

<p>“Unless you can raise the rest of the ten thousand
dollars,” put in Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” spoke the miner.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on the department store proprietor,
“we have talked the matter over,” and he
indicated Mrs. Hopkins, the rich widow, and
Mr. Baker, the banker. “We have decided that
it would be too bad to lose the mine, and we have
also agreed that you boys may make the trip after
the nuggets—but——”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” yelled Bob, Ned and Jerry in a
chorus.</p>

<p>“Wait!” exclaimed Mr. Slade, holding up
his hand. “I’m not done yet. If we advance the
necessary ten thousand dollars, as a syndicate of
three, to secure the option, will you agree to
reimburse us when you get the nuggets, and take
possession of the mine?” he asked of Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>“I sure will!” cried the prospector. “I’ll
sign any kind of paper you like.”</p>

<p>“And I will too!” declared Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“Well, we thought you would,” went on the
merchant; “so I had a contract drawn up. We
have investigated your story,” he said to the
prospector, “and think it is all right. We will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
let the boys have a try at finding the hidden
nuggets.</p>

<p>“But mind you!” he exclaimed, becoming serious,
and looking at the three chums, “it’s up to
you boys now to find those nuggets, and keep
’em after you find ’em, or we’ll lose the ten thousand
dollars we advance. You’ve got to find
that gold!”</p>

<p>“And we’ll do it!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“We sure will!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“When can we start?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Just as soon as the papers can be prepared,”
answered his father. “Remember this trip isn’t
all for fun. There are grave responsibilities attached
to it, for, though the ten thousand dollars
will be advanced by the three of us, still none of
us wish to sustain a loss. So—find those
sixty nuggets!” he finished, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get ’em—if those other fellows
haven’t located ’em; and I don’t believe they
have,” declared Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” began Mr. Baker, “now that
is settled I think we can——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a rush of feet on the
porch, and a shrill voice cried out:</p>

<p>“Hey, Bob! Jerry! Ned! Come on! Noddy
Nixon is running off in your motor boat!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A NIGHT CHASE</small></h2>


<p>“Who’s that?” cried Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“The rapid-fire chap!” exclaimed his partner.</p>

<p>“That’s right—It’s Andy Rush,” declared
Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to talk, Chunky!” fairly shouted
Jerry, giving his stout chum the nickname sometimes
applied to him. “Get a move on! If
Noddy Nixon is trying some more of his tricks
we’ll stop him short.”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” cried Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” added Harvey Brill.</p>

<p>By this time Jerry had reached the hall and
caught up his hat. His example was followed
by his chums and the two Westerners. As for
Mr. Baker and Mr. Slade they sat back helplessly
in their chairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins looked alarmed at first, and
then with a resigned air said:</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there’s no use worrying. Noddy
and the boys are having one of their periodical
outbreaks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“That young scamp ought to be sent out of
the country,” declared Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jerry and his chums had reached
the porch, where they found Andy Rush awaiting
them.</p>

<p>“When did it happen?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Where did he go with our boat?” came
from Jerry.</p>

<p>“Up the river!” panted the small chap, still
breathing hard from his running and shouting.
“I happened to come past the dock—I saw
someone down there—it was dark—couldn’t
make out who it was—thought it was you fellows—I
yelled—wanted a ride—no answer—thought
that was funny—ran down—just in time
to see Noddy and Bill Berry start off—wow!”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Told Noddy he’d better not take your boat—said
I’d tell you.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“Just laughed and put on more power. Better
hurry, if you want to catch him!”</p>

<p>“Of course we do!” asserted Ned; “but how
can we if he has our boat, a good start and is
heading up stream? We’d better tell the
police——”</p>

<p>“Police nothing!” snapped Jerry Hopkins.
“We’ll attend to this case ourselves!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” exclaimed Mr.
Nestor. “And when we get hold of that Noddy
Nixon we’ll make him walk Spanish!”</p>

<p>“But it’s dark,” objected Bob. “We can’t
see him, and besides, we have no other boat!”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry shortly, as he raced
toward the street. “Never mind the dark—we
can get a lantern.”</p>

<p>“But a boat?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Down at the club house!” said Jerry, tersely.
“We’ll borrow one of the craft—I guess they
won’t mind. We’ve got to get our boat!”</p>

<p>“I’m on!” yelled Ned, as he raced beside his
chum and Andy Rush, Bob, being heavier,
brought up the rear with the two men, who were
not used to running. However, all made fair
time.</p>

<p>Jerry led the way toward the river. The
motor boys had their own private boathouse,
where their craft, the <i>Dartaway</i>, was kept.
This was not their original motor boat of that
name, for their first boat had met an untimely
fate in a wreck, as my old readers know. But
the lads had kept the name, and had bestowed it
on a much larger and finer boat which they now
owned.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he took our boat
for?” asked Ned of Andy, as they raced on.</p>

<p>“Just to be mean,” declared the small chap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“His own was probably out of commission,”
put in Jerry. “It usually is, and I guess he
wanted a ride, so he took ours.”</p>

<p>“He may damage it,” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“It would be just like him to,” asserted Andy.
“He doesn’t care where he runs with a boat or
an auto.”</p>

<p>“No, nor an airship either,” said Jerry. For
Noddy, following the example of the motor boys,
had managed to acquire a craft of the air, as
well as one that skimmed over the water. He
also owned an automobile.</p>

<p>“Think there’ll be any boats at the club
house?” asked Ned, as they neared the river.</p>

<p>“There usually are at this time in the evening,”
said Jerry. “We’ll confiscate one if we
have to.”</p>

<p>During the past year the Cresville Athletic
Club, to which our heroes belonged, had branched
out into aquatics, and had built a fine boathouse
on the river for the use of such of its members
as had motor boats. As Jerry said, there were
usually one or more such craft at the dock these
Spring evenings.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, for dinner, at which
had been talked over the plan for getting
the sixty nuggets of gold, had been somewhat
protracted, and night had fallen when Andy
Rush made his startling announcement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are two boats!” cried Ned, as he and
Jerry, in the lead, came in sight of the club house.</p>

<p>“Yes, one is Mr. Wakefield’s <i>Iris</i>,” said Jerry,
who knew every boat in the club. “And the
other is Mr. Wood’s <i>Eel</i>.”</p>

<p>“Which one’ll you take?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Eel</i>, I guess. She’s faster, though not
so easy to handle. Pile in! Do you see anything
of him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there he is, just going up to the reading
room,” spoke Ned, for there was a separate
building from the boathouse where the club
members could read, or get a light lunch. “Shall
I call to him?”</p>

<p>“No, just run up and explain things to him,”
suggested Jerry. “I’ll be getting his boat in
shape for the chase. I’ll have to light the lamps
and see if there’s gas enough. Andy and Bob
will help me. We’ll be ready to start when you
come back. I know Mr. Wood will let us take
the <i>Eel</i>.”</p>

<p>Ned raced off to catch the club member, and
quickly explained what was wanted. Mr. Wood
was an enthusiastic motorist, and had taken an
interest in our heroes ever since they rode their
first bicycle race under the club auspices, and
had won motorcycles.</p>

<p>“Take my boat?” he cried. “Of course you
may! She’s full of gasoline and all ready for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fast run. Go as far as you like! That Noddy
Nixon again; eh? You fellows will have to teach
him a lesson!”</p>

<p>“We have, but it doesn’t seem to do much
good,” complained Ned, as he turned back to rejoin
Jerry, who was busy getting the <i>Eel</i> in shape
for the pursuit.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Nestor and his partner, together
with Bob, had caught up with the others.
Andy was helping Jerry light the port, starboard
and stern lights, as well as the white one in the
bow.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded Mr. Nestor.</p>

<p>“Going to start the stamp-mill going?” asked
his friend.</p>

<p>“We’re going to catch the fellow that has our
boat!” explained Jerry. “Get aboard.”</p>

<p>They got into the <i>Eel</i>, several club members
coming down to the dock to learn the cause of
the excitement.</p>

<p>“I hope you catch him!” exclaimed Mr.
Wakefield, the club’s athletic instructor. He had
no love for Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>With Jerry at the helm, Ned cranked up, spinning
the flywheel over. At the first try the <i>Eel</i>
responded, and, with a series of powerful explosions
in the cylinders, started away from the
dock. Jerry headed up stream, in the direction
Andy said Noddy had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Though he may have turned around again
and steered for the lake,” said Ned. “Better go
a bit slow, Jerry, until you get some trace of
him.”</p>

<p>“I will. I’ll light the search lamp, too, and
we may be able to pick him up when quite a way
off. We’ll stop at the next club house to inquire
if he passed.” For there was another boating association
about five miles up the stream.</p>

<p>The search light sent out an intense white
gleam over the dark waters of the river as the
night chase was begun. The <i>Eel</i> glided ahead
not unlike her namesake, and the motor boys,
and their friends, with eager eyes, looked forward
for the first glimpse of the bully who had
their craft.</p>

<p>“This is some traveling!” exclaimed Jim
Nestor admiringly, as the speed increased.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed his partner. “It beats
a pack mule or a burro!”</p>

<p>“Wait until you ride in <em>our</em> boat,” said Ned,
with proper pride. “We’ll take you on a little
trip before we start for the border.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<small>MAROONED</small></h2>


<p>With Ned to attend to the engine, to see that
it got the right amount of oil, and, occasionally,
to adjust the carburetor, and Jerry at the wheel,
guiding the craft, the <i>Eel</i> darted up the river.
Every eye was on the alert to catch the first
glimpse of the boat which they were pursuing.</p>

<p>“Think he can have gotten much ahead of
you?” asked Mr. Nestor, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Well, he had quite a start,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>“And our boat can go some, if she’s handled
rightly,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“The fastest on the river—in her class,”
added Bob, proudly. “But this is likely to be a
long chase. I wish——”</p>

<p>Bob paused, but Ned, with a chuckle, said:</p>

<p>“I know what Chunky was thinking of.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the stout lad, defiantly.</p>

<p>“That we should have brought a lunch along!
Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going to be out half the night
we’ll need it,” declared Bob, in self-defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t be out all night if we once get
sight of Noddy,” declared Jerry, with conviction.
“As soon as he sees us after him he’ll give
in—he’s that kind!”</p>

<p>The <i>Eel</i> was making good progress, and Jerry
knew he could depend on Ned to get more speed
out of her when needed. But as yet they had
seen no signs of their own boat.</p>

<p>On up the river they swept, the searchlight
throwing out a brilliant gleam, and bringing into
bold relief the trees and bushes along the shore.
Bob had joined Jerry in the bow, while Ned was
at the motor, and the two men and Andy Rush occupied
one of the rear seats. Suddenly the stout
lad uttered a cry:</p>

<p>“There’s something dead ahead!” Those in
the boat thrilled at his words, but a damper was
soon put on their enthusiasm when Jerry said:</p>

<p>“False alarm. That’s only a log of wood.
It’s a good thing you saw it, though, for we might
have rammed it, and, going as fast as we are, we
might have stove a hole in the hull. All right,
Chunky!”</p>

<p>Once more there was silence, broken only by
the chug of the motor, and the slight squeak as
the steering rope passed over the pulleys and
around the drum.</p>

<p>“There’s the Riverview club house!” remarked
Ned, in a low voice, as they made a turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in the stream and saw a lighted building ahead
of them.</p>

<p>“We’ll stop there and inquire,” decided Jerry,
and a little later they tied up at the dock. As
members of the Cresville club our heroes had
visiting privileges at the other organization, and
they were made welcome.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t seen anything of your boat,”
said several lads whom Jerry and his chums
knew well. A number of the older members,
who had been sitting on the dock enjoying their
cigars, said the same thing, for the <i>Dartaway</i>
was well known as one of the finest craft on the
stream.</p>

<p>“Maybe he went down with the current,”
suggested Lloyd Berger, the president of the
organization.</p>

<p>“If he did we’ve had this much of the chase
for nothing,” said Jerry, regretfully. “And
yet——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” put in one of the boatmen hired
by the club, “but could it be that fellow who
took your launch would be running without
lights?”</p>

<p>“He might!” cried Ned, eagerly. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Because, a little while ago,” said the man;
“I saw some sort of a craft go up the river,
away on the other side. She didn’t show a gleam,
and it was so dark that the only way I glimpsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
her was when she came in range with our signal
lamp on the post,” and he pointed to a lantern
set to guide craft to the club float. “At first I
thought it might be some fishermen in a big rowboat,”
the man went on; “for I didn’t hear any
motor, but when I got that view of her I saw it
was built different from a small craft. Yet there
wasn’t any noise.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Dartaway</i> runs as quietly as a sewing
machine at some speeds,” said Jerry. “If that
was Noddy he must have slowed down purposely
on passing here.”</p>

<p>“And I’d be willing to put up a sugar cookie
against a cent that it was him!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Chunky, you might lose, and then
you’d be hungry,” laughed Ned. “But it does
look suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Come on then!” cried the tall lad. “We’ll
keep up stream for a while!”</p>

<p>Once again they were on their way, cutting
through the black water, illuminated by the
gleams of their lamps and the searchlight.</p>

<p>They had gone perhaps four miles above the
Riverview club house when, as they shot around
a bend in the stream, little Andy Rush, sitting beside
Jerry, sprang up, grasped the arm of the
steersman, and cried out:</p>

<p>“There he is! I see your boat! Go to it—catch
him—ram him—run him down! Whoop!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
See where the searchlight reflects on the stern
of that boat!” and he pointed ahead.</p>

<p>Jerry, who was steering with one hand, and
manipulating the searchlight with the other,
swung the gleaming shaft of brilliancy so that it
took in the craft ahead. Then he gave a shout
of delight.</p>

<p>“That’s our boat!” he yelled. “Now for the
end of the chase! Give her all she’ll stand,
Ned!”</p>

<p>Immediately all was excitement aboard the
<i>Eel</i>. Mr. Brill gave a whoop, which Jim Nestor
echoed, and then the man who had hidden the
sixty golden nuggets drew something from his
pocket with a flourish, and asked:</p>

<p>“Shall I plug a hole in her below the water
line, boys, and make him stop to bail?”</p>

<p>“Here! Put up that shooting iron!” cried
Jim. “Where do you think you are—on the
border, or down in Arizona? These Eastern
folks don’t do things that way!”</p>

<p>“More’s the pity!” exclaimed the miner.
“But I could plug him as easy as not,” and he
sighed regretfully, for the boat ahead offered a
splendid mark.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’d sink our craft if you did any
‘plugging,’” said Jerry. “Never mind, we’ll
catch him, for he won’t know how to get the best
speed out of the <i>Dartaway</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s no one in her!” cried Ned, as in
response to the further supply of gasoline he
fed to the motor, at the same time advancing
her spark, the <i>Eel</i> crept up on the other boat.
“They’ve abandoned her, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“No, she’s being steered,” declared the tall
lad, who had observed that their craft kept on a
straight course. “They’re hiding down in the
cockpit,” he added. “They’re afraid!”</p>

<p>“And they’d better be!” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“They’re drawing away from us,” said Ned
regretfully, after a few moments.</p>

<p>“Can you give us any more speed?” asked
Jerry, in a low voice; for he, too, had noticed that
their craft was increasing the distance between
them.</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” answered Ned, and he once more
adjusted the carburetor. The result was at once
apparent, for the <i>Eel</i> shot ahead at increased
speed.</p>

<p>“We’re creeping up on them!” cried Andy, a
minute later.</p>

<p>“No, they’re slowing down!” exclaimed
Jerry. “I thought so. They’re monkeying
with the motor, and they’ve got it adjusted
wrong. We’ll get to ’em now! Hold her so,
Ned!”</p>

<p>Ned nodded without speaking, and the <i>Eel</i>
kept up her fast motion. Now some commotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
could be noted aboard the <i>Dartaway</i>, and Jerry
cried out:</p>

<p>“Hold on there, Noddy Nixon! Come back
with that boat, if you know what’s good for
you!”</p>

<p>“Let’s see you catch us!” fired back the bully,
while Bill Berry added:</p>

<p>“We’ll sink your craft if you don’t keep
back!”</p>

<p>“We’re coming on!” declared Jerry, defiantly,
not at all alarmed by the threat. It was
evident that both Bill and Noddy were doing
their best to get more speed out of the <i>Dartaway</i>,
but without success. Had our heroes been
aboard her, they could have done it, as they
knew every bolt and lever. But the boat seemed
to realize that she was in the hands of enemies,
and refused to do her best.</p>

<p>Slowly the better-managed <i>Eel</i> crept up, until,
when they came to a narrow stretch of the river,
Andy Rush cried:</p>

<p>“They’re going to run her ashore!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” added Bob, as in the gleam
of the search light they saw their craft headed
for the bank.</p>

<p>“They’re giving up!” was Jerry’s opinion,
and so it proved. A little later the “chug-chug!”
of the <i>Dartaway’s</i> engine ceased. She swung up
alongside a little point of land that jutted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
into the stream, two figures leaped out, splashed
into the water and then, running along shore,
vanished in the woods.</p>

<p>“There they go!” cried Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“After ’em!” yelled his partner.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go,” advised Jerry. “We’ve got
our boat back. I want to see if they’ve damaged
her.”</p>

<p>But aside from tools and other things being
scattered carelessly about the craft, no great
harm had been done, which fact was soon ascertained
as the <i>Eel</i> came alongside. The <i>Dartaway</i>
had been rammed into a mud bank, however,
and the <i>Eel</i> had to pull her off. Then, with
Ned and Bob to run her, she was headed down
stream and, convoyed by the <i>Eel</i> she soon came
in sight of the club house where the lads had first
stopped.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out here,” suggested Bob, as they
neared the lighted dock.</p>

<p>“What for—to eat?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No—to telephone home that we’re all right,”
said the stout lad quickly. “Of course,” he added,
“if they invite us to have lunch, it—er—well,
it wouldn’t be polite to refuse; would it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, you old human refrigerator!”
cried Ned, with a laugh. “Hi, Jerry!” he called.
“Ten minutes for refreshments!”</p>

<p>Jerry, who was ahead with the <i>Dartaway</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
laughed and understood. They were soon in the
club house again, being congratulated on their
success. They were invited to have something
to eat, much to Bob’s delight, and they accepted,
after telephoning home that the chase had ended
successfully.</p>

<p>A little later they were under way again, and
had tied their boat at their own boathouse, returning
the <i>Eel</i> to Mr. Wood.</p>

<p>“And what became of Noddy?” asked that
gentleman.</p>

<p>“He disappeared in the woods,” said Jerry.
“It’ll be a long walk back, and it serves him
right.”</p>

<p>They could see no reason why the bully should
want to take their boat, except to annoy them,
though Jerry had a suspicion that Noddy intended
to hide it somewhere to get even for the fancied
injury concerning the false alarm about the gold.
But they never learned definitely.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ll adjourn for the night,”
suggested Jerry, when they were back in Cresville,
and found that their parents had gone to
their several homes after the conference. At
their own houses the boys were told that the
matter of preparing the necessary papers about
the mine would soon be under way, and then they
could start for the border, to search for the hidden
nuggets of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, how about a motor boat ride to-day?”
asked Jerry, of his chums one afternoon, about
a week later. “We promised Jim and his partner
to show them what the <i>Dartaway</i> could do,”
he added.</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it,” suggested Ned. “We can
take a good run up or down the river before
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh—yes—dinner!” put in Bob. Then he
stopped suddenly. “But I’m willing. Only I
say let’s go down stream. There’s a better view,
and we were up the river the other night,” he
added.</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and soon the two Westerners
were in the fine <i>Dartaway</i>, which was
speeded to her limit down the river.</p>

<p>“This sure is some boat!” exclaimed Mr. Brill
in admiration, as he looked at the little cabin,
and at the various appointments.</p>

<p>“If we could only take it out West with us,”
sighed Ned. “But it’s quite a job to pack it.”</p>

<p>“And there isn’t much water out where we’re
going,” said the prospector. “Flathead Lake
is about the biggest.”</p>

<p>“Flathead!” exclaimed Bob. “Is that where
the Flathead Indians are?”</p>

<p>“Well, it might have been named after them,”
admitted Mr. Brill. “Though I guess there
aren’t any Flatheads there now. But there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
some Blackfeet on their reservation, not so very
far away.”</p>

<p>“Blackfeet Indians! Whoop!” yelled Bob.
“Say, we’ll have some sport all right.”</p>

<p>“Not with them,” declared Jerry, decidedly.
“This is no Wild West show we’re going on.
We’re out for business—we’ve got to get those
sixty nuggets.”</p>

<p>“And it won’t be any easy job—with those
grub-stakers after ’em,” murmured Harvey Brill.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” whispered Jim. “These boys
are as game as they make ’em, but there’s no use
crossing a bridge before the cows come home, or
whatever that motto is.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the prospector. “I’m
wise. But say—this is a pretty spot all right.”</p>

<p>“We often camp on that island for a day or
so,” spoke Ned, pointing to a large one in the
middle of the river, which, at this point was
about three miles wide, but not very deep.</p>

<p>“If we had any grub along we could camp
now,” said Bob. “There’s a shack there;
and——”</p>

<p>He got no farther, for at that instant, with a
sort of apologetic cough, the motor stopped and
the boat began to drift toward the island.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned. “Run out
of gasoline?”</p>

<p>“It can’t be that,” declared Jerry, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
puzzled look. “I filled the tank before we
started.”</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” agreed Jerry, as he began to go
over the motor, while Ned steered the drifting
boat toward the island.</p>

<p>Try as he might, Jerry could not get the engine
started again, and they were forced to come to
a stop at a small dock which the boys had made
to accommodate their craft when they camped on
the island. Then, as the afternoon waned, Jerry
and his chums did everything they could think of
to get going again, but it was of no use.</p>

<p>“We’re marooned!” exclaimed Bob, gloomily,
as he looked across to the mainland through the
gathering shadows. “Marooned on the island,
and not a bite to eat!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>NODDY PACKS UP</small></h2>


<p>“What are we going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Can we stay here all night?”</p>

<p>Thus Bob and Ned questioned Jerry, who
stood silently regarding the stalled motor. The
tall lad did not answer at once.</p>

<p>“Kinder balked on you; has she, son?” asked
Mr. Brill, softly. He and Jim Nestor had, with
the others, disembarked from the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” admitted Jerry, with something like
a frown on his face. “And I can’t understand
it.”</p>

<p>“Does it often act up that way?” Jim Nestor
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Not very often,” said Jerry. “We’ve got it
adjusted pretty fine. I can’t see what’s the matter.
There’s a good spark, and there’s gasoline
in the carburetor, for I tested the drain cock.
Yet there doesn’t seem to be an explosion.”</p>

<p>Once more he threw in the switch, and turned
the flywheel. There was a buzz as the coil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
vibrated, showing that the electrical connections
were good, but no explosion followed.</p>

<p>“Ned, you try,” suggested Jerry. “Maybe
I’m the hoodoo.”</p>

<p>Ned stepped in front of the motor. But, before
he attempted to turn the flywheel he gravely
tied a knot in his watch chain.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Jim Nestor.
“Afraid you’ll break the links?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s to break the hoodoo,” answered
Ned. “You know there are so many things that
can happen to a gasoline motor that no one can
number them. Lots of times a little thing like
sprinkling talcum powder on the cylinder head,
or giving the timer a gum drop, will make her
start when nothing else will. I’m just trying the
watch chain as an experiment,” and he grinned
broadly.</p>

<p>But it was of no avail, and the more Ned
labored at turning over the flywheel, the more
the motor seemed to balk.</p>

<p>“I give up!” exclaimed the merchant’s son.
“It’s your turn, Bob.”</p>

<p>The stout lad gravely took out a bit of court
plaster, and pasted it on the magnet of the
dynamo.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Mr. Brill, quickly.</p>

<p>“That’s my way of breaking a hoodoo,” said
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>But that, likewise, was of no avail, and the engine
remained “dead.”</p>

<p>Jerry tried again, with no success, and then
they all sat down on the shore and looked gloomily
at the boat. It was getting late, no other craft
was in sight, and the river at that point was too
wide to admit of signalling, or calling to shore.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s us for an all-night stay,” remarked
Bob, gloomily. “And not a bit of
grub!”</p>

<p>“There would have been some in the box in
the shack if you hadn’t insisted on eating the last
box of sardines,” declared Ned, for often the
boys would spend a day or two camping out on
the island, and they had a small supply of
provisions there.</p>

<p>“Well, I was hungry,” said the fat youth. “I
had to eat ’em.”</p>

<p>“And you’re hungry now,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“If we’ve got to stay here let’s go up to the
cabin, and see what we can do about sleeping,”
proposed Ned. “It’s pretty evident that we can’t
get the motor going now. There must be something
wrong with the valves. It’ll have to be
taken apart. Let’s go to the shack.”</p>

<p>They found the cabin in good shape, and all
of them could sleep there, since it was not cold,
and there were enough covers on the bunks. But
there was no food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to make the best of it,” declared
Jerry. “Let’s go back to the boat, and see
that everything’s safe for the night, and then
we’ll turn in.”</p>

<p>But they were spared the discomforts of a
foodless night on the island. For, when they
were making their craft snug at the improvised
dock, Ned caught the sound of oars on the dark
river.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat!” he exclaimed. “Let’s
yell!”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” agreed Jerry, and they raised
their voices.</p>

<p>“What you want?” came the answering hail,
as the sound of rowing ceased.</p>

<p>“We’re stuck on the island,” answered Ned.
“We want to be taken ashore. Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“Sud Snuffles,” was the answer, and the boys
at once recognized the voice of a queer character
about town—a man whom they often hired to do
odd tasks. Sud was a person very fond of going
about, and he had the faculty of getting into
trouble, and out again, with ease. Just now he
was a welcome friend.</p>

<p>“Take us ashore, Sud,” called Jerry. “Our
boat has gone back on us.”</p>

<p>“Quarter apiece!” exclaimed the practical
Sud. “Can’t do it for any less. I’m fishin’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
if I stop to ferry you folks over I may miss a
nice mess. Quarter apiece!”</p>

<p>“That’s a go!” cried Jerry, glad of the
chance to get to the mainland. “We’ll leave
our boat here and come for it to-morrow. I’m
sorry,” he said to the two Westerners, “that we
couldn’t give you a better trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” spoke Jim, with a broad
grin.</p>

<p>“Wait until you get in our airship,” suggested
Ned. “When we swoop above the clouds——”</p>

<p>“I s’pose then, when anything happens, you
just rest on a cloud bank until it’s fixed,” said the
miner, grimly.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t fall, at any rate!” exclaimed
Jerry.</p>

<p>Sud rowed up, and soon had them all in his
boat. It was rather crowded, but he got them
safely ashore, and collected his fee.</p>

<p>The boys lost no time seeking their homes,
and Bob was in such a hurry that he left his companions
far behind.</p>

<p>“My! he must be hungry!” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>The next day, in a rowboat, they went for their
disabled craft. Once more Jerry and his chums
tried to start it, but without success, and they
had to tow it back.</p>

<p>At their home dock they went carefully over
it. While they were at it Professor Snodgrass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
who had not been much in the company of the
chums of late, came up.</p>

<p>“When do we start for the place of the
luminous snakes, boys?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Soon,” answered Jerry. “We are just as
anxious as you are,” and he reached for a monkey
wrench on a locker beside him.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried the scientist. “Don’t touch
that!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry. “Is it
too hot, from having been in the sun?”</p>

<p>“No, my lad, but on the handle is one of the
rarest dragon flies I have ever seen. Don’t move,
any of you, and I’ll have him in a second. Oh,
the beauty!” and the professor, from one of his
many pockets, pulled out a small insect net. Carefully
getting into the boat, he poised the net above
the dragon fly on the wrench handle. There was
a swoop, an excited exclamation, and the next
moment the professor had leaped out on the dock
and was racing along the river bank, crying:</p>

<p>“He got away! Oh, the little beauty! He
escaped me, but I’ll get him yet!” and away he
raced after the specimen.</p>

<p>“He’s good for all day,” murmured Jerry, as
he took up the wrench.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Take off the gasoline pipe. There must be
some stoppage in it. No more gasoline drips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
from the carburetor, as it did at first, so there
must be something in the pipe.”</p>

<p>It did not take long to remove the connections.
Jerry probed a bit at the gasoline tank outlet and
then, as a sudden flow of the fluid came, he
cried:</p>

<p>“There it is! A bit of waste right where the
pipe fits on the tank. There’s been some trick
here!”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder a bit. The night he took
our boat he must have unscrewed the gasoline
tank cover and dropped a bit of waste in. It
took until now to float down into the opening,
and no wonder we couldn’t start the motor with
no gas in her. There must be something wrong
with the carburetor, too, or she’d have run on
what was in that. I’ll look.”</p>

<p>He found that the carburetor had been so
tampered with that, while there was gasoline in
the base of it there was none that could be drawn
into the cylinder chambers. With the removal
of the waste, and the adjusting of the carburetor,
the motor started off at the first turn of the flywheel.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Ned. “Now we’re all
right. We’ll give Jim and Harvey another ride
before we start for Montana and the sixty
nuggets of gold! Ugh!” he suddenly grunted, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Jerry nudged him in the ribs. “What’s that
for?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see Bill Berry passing just as you
said that, Bob?” demanded the tall youth.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Well, he just sneaked past, and I’m sure he
heard you. We’ve got to be careful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he and Noddy won’t bother us
any more.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope not, but I’d just as soon they
didn’t know anything of our affairs. I’m going to
do one thing, though.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see Noddy, and give him one
piece of my mind! The idea of putting our boat
out of commission that way! I’ve a good notion
to make a complaint of malicious mischief against
him.”</p>

<p>“It would serve him right if you did.”</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was soon in running order, and
the boys gave the two Westerners a fine ride
down the river. That afternoon, on returning
to their boathouse, and recalling what trouble
they had had the night before, Jerry determined
to make a formal complaint against the bully.</p>

<p>“We’ve stood enough from him!” he exclaimed.
“It’s time he found out he can’t do as
he pleases!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed his chums, and Jerry,
having secured the boat, started for the office of
the family lawyer, to make a formal complaint
against Noddy.</p>

<p>As he was about to enter he saw Andy Rush
hurrying along.</p>

<p>“He looks as if he had some news,” mused the
tall lad. “Hello, Andy!” he greeted. “What’s
up?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“No, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon packed up to-day, and he and
Bill Berry left town in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“They did?” cried Jerry. “I wonder if he
heard about the complaint I was going to make
against him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Andy. “But I
happened to be down at the station when he and
Bill took the train. And their baggage was
checked for some place in Montana.”</p>

<p>“Montana!” cried Jerry. “Are you sure of
this, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am!” exclaimed the small chap.</p>

<p>“Then he’s heard something about the sixty
nuggets of gold!” murmured Jerry. “He’s going
to have a try for them. We’ve got to get
ahead of him!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>AN AIRSHIP FLIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“Well, there’s no use going in now,” said
Jerry, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Going in where?” asked Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“To consult our lawyer. I was going to see
about making a complaint against Noddy. But
what’s the use, if he’s skipped out?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he heard what you were going to do,”
suggested the small chap.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the tall lad, “I didn’t tell
anyone, except Ned and Bob. I guess Noddy
left because—well, because he wanted to,” he concluded
quickly, for Andy Rush did not know of
the prospective journey of the motor boys. In
fact, their intention to seek for the gold was kept
as quiet as possible, for they realized how such
rumors spread.</p>

<p>So, as a matter of fact, only the boys, the two
Westerners, and the parents of our heroes, knew
of the proposed trip.</p>

<p>“That is unless Noddy has overheard something,
and suspects,” murmured Jerry, as he
turned back toward home. “And it looks as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
he had from the way he hurried off. And to
Montana, too! What part of Montana was his
baggage checked to?” he asked, of Andy.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t make out the tags very well, but
the last part of the name was ‘Spell,’” spoke the
excitable youth.</p>

<p>“Spell—spell,” murmured Jerry. “I have it—the
town of Kabspell—it’s near Flathead Lake,
and we were counting on sending our airship
there to make the start! Noddy has gotten on
to our plans somehow!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Andy, quickly, for
Jerry was half talking to himself.</p>

<p>“Oh—nothing. I was just wondering what
Noddy would do, that’s all. Much obliged for
telling me. Here’s a quarter, Andy. Get yourself
a soda.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! I will,” and Andy, forgetting
Jerry’s rather strange and worried actions, in the
prospective delights of a soda, hurried off.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get busy,” decided the tall lad,
as he made his way home. Quickly he called up
his chums by telephone, and when they were assembled
at his house, with Mr. Nestor and Mr.
Brill in attendance, while Professor Snodgrass
hovered in the background, Jerry told them the
news.</p>

<p>“That means we’ve got to get started right
away,” decided Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Jim Nestor. “I know
Noddy Nixon of old, and while he may not know
just where the nuggets are hidden, he’s got just
luck enough to stumble on the trail of some of
those grub-stakers, who have a general idea.
We’d better get off as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better, I say,” put in Professor
Snodgrass. “I’ve caught about all the
rare insects there are in these parts, and I do
want to get some of those luminous snakes. Can
we start to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Jerry, with a smile. “If we’re
going to take the airship we’ll have to give it a
trial, and then take it apart for shipment. That
will take some time. But in a week I think we
could be on the move.”</p>

<p>“If you have fully decided to go,” said Mrs.
Hopkins, who just then entered the room; “and
I suppose that you have, there is no use in delaying,
Jerry. Really, I am a little worried about
the dangers of the trip, but since we have invested
our money in it, I would rather you than
that Nixon boy get the gold nuggets.”</p>

<p>“That’s what, momsey!” cried Jerry, kissing
her, at which she laughed, for mother and son
were great “chums.”</p>

<p>“Then trot out the airship and let’s give her
a trial!” exclaimed Harvey Brill. “I’ve never
ridden in one of the shebangs, but I’ll take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
chance in one. The papers are all fixed up now,
I have telegraphed the money to take up the
option on the mine, and all that’s to be done is
to go get the hidden nuggets.”</p>

<p>“And the snakes—don’t forget them,” put in
the scientist, eagerly watching a fly on the wall,
as if hoping it would prove to be a rare
variety.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry. “There’s just one
point to be thought of though, and when the professor
mentioned snakes it occurred to me. Now
we don’t want to start off and arrive on the
border as a party of prospectors looking for gold
nuggets. If we do, we’ll have a trail of men after
us who are always on the lookout to take advantage
of news of a rich strike. And, too, if
the grub-stakers are still on the watch, they’ll
hear about us and make trouble.”</p>

<p>“What can we do, though?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Pretend that we’re a party of scientists out
for rare specimens of various kinds. In effect
Professor Snodgrass will be the head of the
scientific expedition, and we will be his assistants.
How is that?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“That ought to fool ’em,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I think it will be just the thing,” came from
Jim Nestor. “As you say, Jerry, we want to
keep this thing as quiet as possible. So, Professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you can regard us as members of your
luminous-snake-hunting expedition.”</p>

<p>“I am agreeable,” spoke the scientist, with a
smile. “And I hope we are successful.”</p>

<p>The motorship, <i>Comet</i>, was floated out of the
big shed for a trial flight the next day. Harvey
Brill was the only one of the party who had not
seen it, and his astonishment was a sight to behold.
At first he could scarcely believe that it
would mount into the air, for the <i>Comet</i> was of
large size.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll go up,” said Jerry; “and you’ll
go with her.”</p>

<p>“I’m game!” exclaimed the miner, grimly.</p>

<p>As I have already described the motorship in
previous books of this series I will not go into
details now. Sufficient to say that the <i>Comet</i> was
a combined aeroplane and dirigible balloon. It
had also a hydroplane attachment, enabling it to
float on water, and skim over its surface.</p>

<p>There was a powerful motor aboard, that
whirled the propellers, causing the ship to advance.
This feature could be used when the craft
was an aeroplane or dirigible. When it was desired
to progress as the latter style of craft the
bag could be inflated with a powerful gas, generated
aboard the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>There was an engine room, a pilot house,
sleeping and eating quarters, and a large living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
room. Provisions for many days could be carried
aboard, and the kitchen was the delight of
Bob’s heart. He spent much of his time there
when on a trip, concocting new and dainty dishes.</p>

<p>In fact the <i>Comet</i> was a veritable motorship of
the air, as much so as a yacht would be on some
lake or ocean. In it the boys had traveled many
thousands of miles, and had visited places which
would have been inaccessible but for their unique
craft, much of which they had built themselves,
with the help of a veteran balloonist.</p>

<p>“Well, get aboard!” called Jerry, when he
had seen that everything was in readiness. The
professor took his place with as much unconcern
as if he was going for an auto ride. He had
an insect net with him, for he often got curious
creatures of the upper air on these trips. Jim
Nestor had often ridden in the <i>Comet</i>, and of
course to Bob and Ned it was an old story. But
Mr. Brill hesitated about getting into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Are you sure she won’t bust and come down
with us?” he asked, nervously.</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Jerry, with a laugh. “Get
aboard,” and the mining prospector did so, but
with evident reluctance.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” cried Jerry to Ned, who was in
the engine room, with Bob, while the tall lad held
the steering wheel. The big propellers whizzed
around, the motorship quivered from end to end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and then began to shoot across the ground on the
starting wheels.</p>

<p>“Gee whizz! We’re moving!” cried Harvey
Brill.</p>

<p>Jerry yanked back on the lever that adjusted
the elevation rudder. The nose of the <i>Comet</i> was
pointed upward and she shot into the air on a
slant.</p>

<p>“We’re going up!” yelled the astonished and
almost delighted Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>“I told you we would,” asserted his partner,
as if it was an every-day occurrence with him.</p>

<p>Rapidly the craft soared upward, and in a few
minutes it was floating several hundred feet above
the town of Cresville. Higher and higher it
mounted.</p>

<p>“How’s she running, Ned?” asked Jerry,
from the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Fine. The motor’s going like a sewing machine.
Is she steering all right?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better. I guess she’ll do.”</p>

<p>“And it’s this shebang you’re going to ship out
West to go down into the valley where I’ve
hidden my nuggets?” asked the prospector.</p>

<p>“This is it,” answered Jerry. “If you’ll
come up here I’ll show you how I control her,”
and when Mr. Brill entered the pilot house Jerry
pointed out the various levers and wheels.</p>

<p>“What’s this one for?” asked the Westerner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as he touched a small lever. Quite by accident he
moved it a trifle. Instantly there was a snapping
and crackling sound in the motor room, and the
<i>Comet</i> gave a sickening lurch.</p>

<p>“We’re falling!” cried Mr. Brill. “We’re
going down! I know! I fell in an elevator once!
We’re falling down!” and he jumped back in
terror, and sought to climb out of the window of
the pilot house.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR THE BORDER</small></h2>


<p>“Here! Come back!” yelled Jerry, making a
grab for the Westerner. “Don’t jump!”</p>

<p>“But we’re falling! I’m not going to stay in
here and be killed!”</p>

<p>“You’ll be killed sure if you jump. But there’s
no danger!”</p>

<p>“No danger? And we falling down about a
mile? No danger?” Mr. Brill was greatly excited.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Jerry, with a smile. “You
pulled the emergency lever, that stopped the
motor suddenly, but I’ll start the gas machine, and
we’ll float like a balloon until the motor gets to
working again.”</p>

<p>The Westerner seemed doubtful, and there
was even a worried look on the face of Jim
Nestor. For, though he trusted fully to the boys,
he could not recall ever having had an experience
like this before.</p>

<p>And, undoubtedly, the <i>Comet</i> was falling
earthward at great speed. But a look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
three boys—showing them calm and collected—and
another glance at Professor Snodgrass, who
was eagerly scanning the air for a sight of some
rare insect, rather put the Westerners more at
their ease.</p>

<p>“Are you sure there’s no danger?” asked Mr.
Brill, as he made his way back into the pilot
house.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” answered Jerry. “You see we
are not falling as rapidly as we were,” and he
indicated a dial on the side wall, the hand of
which registered the height. It had moved
rapidly over the clock-face, but now was going
more slowly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t started the gas machine yet,” went
on the young pilot; “but I threw up the head
planes, and so checked the descent, just as a birdman
volplanes to earth with his motor shut off.
Now I’ll start the gas generator, and we’ll become
a dirigible balloon for a change. Let her
go, Ned!”</p>

<p>Ned, with Bob’s aid, swung over the handle
that set the gas generating machine in operation,
and, with a hiss, the powerful vapor began to fill
the big bag. In a few minutes all downward
motion was checked, and the <i>Comet</i> floated in the
air—a balloon.</p>

<p>“Well I’ll be grub-staked!” exclaimed Mr.
Brill. “That was clever, all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sure was,” agreed his partner.</p>

<p>But Jerry had not finished testing the <i>Comet</i>,
for he wanted it to be in perfect trim for the difficult
work ahead of them.</p>

<p>Accordingly the propellers were again started
and the motorship was driven here and there as a
dirigible. It behaved well, too, and needed but
little adjusting. Then they went far up above the
clouds, and Mr. Snodgrass managed to get a
new specimen of a fly, which greatly delighted
him.</p>

<p>“Now for the hydroplanes, and I guess we’ll
be through,” said the steersman, as he guided the
craft toward the river and dropped down on the
surface. The big floats buoyed up the motorship,
and then, by the power of her propellers,
she navigated the stream with considerable speed.
A number of motor boats from the club saluted
Jerry and his chums.</p>

<p>“Well, this sure is a great get-up!” complimented
Mr. Brill. “She can travel on land, on
water, and in the air.”</p>

<p>“We can’t do much in the way of land travel,”
said Jerry. “It isn’t exactly an auto, and we
only use the wheels to get a start when we depend
on the planes. Of course, as a balloon, we can
rise without getting a start first. But I guess
we’ll manage to drop down into that valley you
told about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you can’t do it in this, nothing can,” was
the miner’s opinion. “It sure is great!”</p>

<p>The following days were busy ones for the
motor boys and their friends. The <i>Comet</i> had to
be taken apart for shipment to the West, and
many other preparations made for their long
trip. They would travel by rail to Kabspell, and
there reassemble their craft.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll provision her well, I hope,” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll let you look after that, Chunky,”
said Jerry, with a smile.</p>

<p>Their plan was to travel by rail to the small
town in Montana where their airship would be
sent. Once it was put together again they would
use that exclusively.</p>

<p>“And I guess those grub-stakers will have
trouble in following us in that machine!” exclaimed
Mr. Brill, proudly.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon may make trouble,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t his airship with him this time,”
declared Jerry; “and I don’t fancy he can pick up
one out there in a hurry. I guess we can give
him the slip.”</p>

<p>“But Kabspell is quite a way from the valley
where you hid the nuggets; isn’t it?” asked Jim
Nestor, of his partner.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we can easily make the valley from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
there. The nearest place to it is a little settlement
called Bolton, almost on the border between
the United States and Canada. It is at the foot
of the mountains, and the valley is off a rocky
pass. I think we can easily find it. It isn’t a great
distance from the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.”</p>

<p>“Do those Indians ever make trouble?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose that once in a while some of
them get tired of doing nothing and break off the
reservation,” admitted Mr. Brill. “But Jim and
I have our guns and——”</p>

<p>“We’ll take weapons, too,” said Jerry; “but I
hope the only use we find for them will be to shoot
game.”</p>

<p>“Is there game out there?” asked Ned,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the Westerner. “Rocky
Mountain goats, bears, and an occasional mountain
lion or two. And plenty of small game.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Ned. “We’ll have some fun,
even if we don’t get the nuggets!”</p>

<p>“But you want to get them!” insisted his
father, who was at the conference. “That’s
what we’re depending on you for. The syndicate
doesn’t want to lose money!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get ’em!” declared Jerry, confidently.</p>

<p>The preparations went on rapidly, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
soon about done. The motorship had been forwarded
in sections and a supply of gasoline arranged
for in Kabspell. Ostensibly it was given
out that the boys and their friends were going to
help Professor Snodgrass hunt for luminous
snakes, and other strange forms of animal life,
and the scientist was not at all unwilling to head
such an important expedition.</p>

<p>“And from now on,” warned Jerry, when they
were about ready to depart, “not a word about
the sixty nuggets of gold unless we have to
mention them. There’s no telling who may be
listening.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed his chums.</p>

<p>They were at the Cresville station. The last
good-byes had been said, their baggage sent on
ahead, and they were to begin the long trip to the
border land. Andy Rush was there, looking wistful,
for he would have liked to accompany his
friends. Professor Snodgrass was wandering
about, looking for new bugs, and hardly assuming
the character of the leader of the expedition.
But that did not so much matter now.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there appeared in the open door of
the station a very stout woman, carrying a valise
and much wrapped up in a large shawl. Her
eyes roved over the group of travelers, and
lighted on the form of Harvey Brill. Then with
a shrill cry she rushed toward him, exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve found him! Oh, I’ve found him! Oh,
my dear nephew! I have found you at last!
Come home with me! We need you so! Oh, I
have found you!” and she dropped her satchel
and rushed at the miner with extended arms.</p>

<p>As for Harvey Brill, his jaw dropped and a
look almost of terror came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Hide me!” he exclaimed. “Somebody hide
me! This is the first of ’em! I’ve been expecting
this!” and he ran out of the station, full into the
arms of Mr. Hitter, the freight agent, the two
going down in a heap.</p>

<small>THE PROFESSOR IS MISSING</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Something is wrong!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Are they hurt?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>The two figures in the station doorway—Mr.
Brill and the agent—were struggling to arise.
Jim Nestor, perhaps with a half-formed notion
that somebody was trying to rob his friend, made
a motion toward his hip pocket, and then thought
better of it.</p>

<p>The large lady, casting aside her shawl, made
a rush for the two on the floor. Grasping Mr.
Hitter by his coattails, she lifted him to his feet
with ease—for he was not a large man. Then
she assisted Mr. Brill to arise.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Harvey?” she cried. “Oh,
say you’re not hurt! I couldn’t bear to hear that,
and me just finding you! Oh, Harvey, have you
lost any money? Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>Mr. Brill pulled himself away. He eyed Mr.
Hitter for a moment as though he thought the
agent might be responsible, and then he turned
his gaze on the large woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’m not hurt,” he said. “I—I’m all
right. When is our train due?” he asked of the
boys.</p>

<p>“Oh, Harvey, you’re not going away again—after
I have just found you; are you?” exclaimed
the woman. “Aren’t you coming to live
with your dear aunt, and the children and your
uncle? Your uncle hasn’t any work now, and I
know he’ll be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“I expect he will,” said Mr. Brill, gloomily;
“only he isn’t going to see me. If that train
doesn’t come soon, I’m going to walk!” he added,
desperately.</p>

<p>“There’s the whistle!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“But what’s it all about?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, Harvey, don’t leave me!” pleaded the
big woman, again making a rush for him.</p>

<p>“Keep her back—somebody!” cried Mr.
Brill. “Don’t let her get hold of me. Hurry out
to the train.”</p>

<p>Once more he made a rush for the door.</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried Mr. Hitter. “You’re the
fellow who found the gold on the track, and
nearly had the railroad torn up in consequence.
Are you going to do it again? Are you going to
look for more gold?”</p>

<p>“I am not!” fairly yelled Mr. Brill. “Let
me get aboard the train!”</p>

<p>Once more the whistle shrilly sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on!” cried the Westerner, making a
break for the door, and pushing Mr. Hitter aside.</p>

<p>“Stop! Wait for me, Harvey!” cried the
large woman. “I want you to come with me.
We need you—the children need you. Did you
bring any gold with you from the West? Oh!
I have had such a time finding you.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Mr. Brill. “If I don’t get
away now I never will!”</p>

<p>The train pulled into the station, and the Westerner
fairly threw himself aboard. Mr. Hitter
rushed off to look after some baggage, and Jim
Nestor and the boys followed their excited
friend.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Bob, much
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” replied Jerry. “Maybe that’s
one of the poor relations he was telling about,
who want him to support them. He’ll tell us in
the train, I guess. Come on, Professor!”</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” cried the stout lady; but
with a wave of his hand Mr. Brill disappeared
into the smoker.</p>

<p>The motor boys climbed up the steps of the
coach. Professor Snodgrass, making a grab for
a rare bug he saw at the last moment, followed.
The big woman attempted to board the train, but
it was too late, and as it pulled out of the station
she was last seen running after the cars, while, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the smoker, Mr. Brill was heard to say with
much fervor:</p>

<p>“Oh what a lucky escape!”</p>

<p>“What was it all about?” asked Jerry, when
they were all together in the parlor car where
they had seats, Mr. Brill having moved forward.
“Was she one of your relations?”</p>

<p>“She was,” answered the miner, “and one of
the worst. She called herself my aunt, but she
was more like a forty-second cousin. For years
I almost supported her and her family. Her husband
won’t work—he thinks he’s got heart
disease. I gave her what I could spare, and more
too, just as I did a whole lot of others who
thought because I was a gold miner, that I was
rich. But I wasn’t.</p>

<p>“How she found out I was in the East I don’t
know, but some of the poor relations out West
must have sent word that I had come on. Then
she traced me—though I don’t know how—and I
suppose she came for money. But I got away—thank
goodness! I got away. If she had found
me earlier she’d have made life miserable for me.
I had—well, you know what,” he added, in a
whisper, referring to the sixty nuggets of gold.
“It had to be kept quiet, and that’s why I didn’t
want to get the sheriff and a posse to recover my
stuff. Word would have gotten out that I had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and then—well, I wouldn’t have had it, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re safe now,” remarked Ned,
with a smile, as he recalled the scene of excitement
in the depot.</p>

<p>“But she was very determined,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“She was something like you, Chunky—in
build,” spoke Jerry, dryly. “Well, we’re off,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The train sped through familiar scenery and
the boys and their friends gave themselves up to
the delights of it. Mr. Snodgrass busied himself
making notes of the specimens he had captured.</p>

<p>A few seats up from where our friends sat, was
a man with a very black moustache, very “loud”
clothing, and a watch chain that looked strong
enough to restrain a bulldog. He had cast curious
glances at the party as they boarded the train,
and he looked particularly at Mr. Nestor and Mr.
Brill. Presently he sauntered in their direction,
and, pulling out a cigar case, said:</p>

<p>“I guess I’m right in sizing you folks up for a
party of prospectors and miners; am I not?”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, and then
Jerry asked:</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” for the lad
feared they had by accident mentioned the hidden
gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, these gentlemen look like grub-stakers
who have struck it rich,” and he indicated the two
Westerners. “Will you come back and have a
smoke with me?” he invited.</p>

<p>Jim Nestor looked at Jerry, who shook his
head slightly.</p>

<p>“I guess we don’t care to smoke, stranger,”
said the mine superintendent. “And, as for
sizing us up as prospectors who have struck it
rich, you’ve got another guess coming. We’re
out with Professor Uriah Snodgrass in a search
for luminous snakes.”</p>

<p>“Snakes! Huh!” exclaimed the man, who
looked like a gambler or “sport.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” exclaimed the professor, hearing
his favorite topic mentioned. “Snakes of light—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illustris
serpensus</i>—Do you happen to know anything
of them, sir?”</p>

<p>“Who, me? I should say not!” and the man,
evidently much disappointed, moved away.</p>

<p>“He got his all right!” chuckled Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; evidently he thought to scrape an acquaintance
and get us to talk,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“But he had no use for bug-hunters!”
chuckled Mr. Brill. “That’s a good stunt, boys;
to pretend to be scientists. We’ll keep it up. We
can’t be too careful.”</p>

<p>They traveled all that day and night, little of
incident occurring. The black-moustached man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
did not trouble them further. The next day
found them well on their way to the border.</p>

<p>The car they were traveling in was a comfortable
one, and they would not have to change for
some time. There was a dining coach attached
to the train, and Bob rejoiced in looking over the
bill of fare when he had nothing else to do.</p>

<p>It was on the second day out, and toward evening
when they were just beginning to think about
supper that Jerry, who had been walking through
the train to “stretch his legs,” came back to his
friends.</p>

<p>“Have any of you seen the professor?” he
asked, and his voice was a bit troubled.</p>

<p>“The professor?” asked Ned. “Why, he
was here a while ago, making notes to beat the
band.”</p>

<p>“So I saw,” spoke Jerry. “Then I noticed
him get up to go for a drink of water. He didn’t
come back, and I went looking for him. He isn’t
on the train, as far as I can find, and we haven’t
made any stops since.”</p>

<p>“Could he have fallen off?” asked Bob, uneasily.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried Ned. “It would be just like
him. He may have gone on the platform, seen a
rare bug, and in reaching for it lost his balance
and fallen off. I wonder——”</p>

<p>But Ned did not continue. At that instant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
train came to a sudden stop with a grinding of
brakes—such a sudden stop that nearly everyone
in the car was thrown from his seat.</p>

<p>“An accident!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“We’re going to smash!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Something has happened to the professor!”
came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a hold-up!” ejaculated Jim
Nestor, and this time he drew from his hip pocket
something shining. Harvey Brill followed his
example.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER</small></h2>


<p>With a further grinding of the brake shoes on
the wheels, and many bumps, the train came to
an abrupt stop. But there followed no terrifying
crash, no overturning of the coaches, no splintering
of woodwork, no bending of steel trusses, and
no explosion of the locomotive boiler.</p>

<p>The passengers who had been tossed from their
seats slowly arose, little the worse for the adventure
save bruises. Then came a silence, to be
broken by Bob, who asked:</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Lots of things, I guess,” replied Ned, rubbing
his elbow where it had come in contact with
the edge of a seat.</p>

<p>“We may have just escaped a collision,” said
Jerry, starting toward the door. “That was the
emergency air brake that went on so suddenly.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hold-up—that’s what it is!” declared
Jim Nestor. “I’ve been through ’em before and
I know. Get your guns ready, boys. You’re
heeled, aren’t you, Harvey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sure am, and I’m ready to fight at the drop
of the hat. I haven’t much with me, but what I
have I’m going to keep.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” declared Jim, getting behind one
of the chair seats, after he had picked himself up
out of a corner where he had been tossed by the
sudden, jolting stop of the train. “Get behind
one of these chairs, Harvey,” advised the mine
foreman, “and when the rascals come in cover
’em before they get a chance to get the drop on
us.”</p>

<p>“I’m wise, partner!”</p>

<p>The door at the end of the car opened and a
man rushed in.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” yelled Jim and Harvey, in the
same breath, and from behind the backs of their
respective chairs two shining weapons covered the
intruder. “Hands up! You can’t come any
game like that!” went on Harvey Brill.</p>

<p>“What—what’s that? Train robbers! How
did they get in here! I see! That’s why the
brake cord was pulled! I—I——”</p>

<p>“Put up your guns!” cried Jerry, with a laugh.
“This is the Pullman conductor, Jim. Put away
those pistols! It’s all right, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Slowly Jim and his friend peered over the tops
of the seats, and, as they saw the uniform of the
train official, sheepish smiles spread over their
countenances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be horn-swoggled!” exclaimed
Jim.</p>

<p>“And I’ll be grub-staked!” added Harvey,
that seeming to be a favorite expression of his.</p>

<p>“Oh, you took me for a hold-up man!” exclaimed
the conductor, a note of relief in his voice.
“And I did the same by you. But something
happened. Someone pulled the emergency air
brake cord, and stopped the train almost within a
length. Did any one here do it? And what
for?”</p>

<p>“No one that we saw,” replied Jerry. “But
something has evidently happened. One of our
party—the head of it I may say,” he added, thinking
to carry out the plan they had adopted—“Professor
Snodgrass—is missing. I just discovered
that he was gone when the train was
pulled up. We fear he may have fallen off in going
from one car to another.”</p>

<p>“That is hardly possible,” said the conductor.
“This is a vestibuled train, and it is as safe to go
from one car to another as it is to walk the
length of a coach. He could not have fallen off.”</p>

<p>“Then where is he?” asked Ned, and the boys
looked at one another in alarm. At that moment,
from the rear end of the car they were in, came a
voice crying:</p>

<p>“I have it! Oh, I have you my little beauty!
You tried to get away from me, but I have you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“The professor!” cried Ned, Bob and Jerry,
in a chorus.</p>

<p>They made a rush in the direction of the voice,
and, a moment later, they saw their eccentric
friend perched high up in a corner of the outer
vestibule of the parlor car. He was supporting
himself by standing on some small iron projection,
his head was well up under the “hood” of the
car, and, while clinging with one hand to the
emergency air brake cord, with the other he
clutched his prize.</p>

<p>“Is—is that you, Professor?” asked Jerry,
hardly knowing what he was saying.</p>

<p>“Certainly it is, my boy,” was the calm answer,
as the scientist surveyed the little group of astonished
ones on the car platform below him.
“Certainly I am here.”</p>

<p>“And—and did you——?” faltered Jerry.</p>

<p>“I certainly did. I captured it, the little
beauty!” interrupted the scientist. “It is a most
perfect specimen of the jumping Buffalo moth I
have ever seen. I was passing from one car to
the other when here, in the vestibule, I saw the
moth. I tried to get it, but it jumped higher and
higher, and I was forced to climb up. Then I got
it, when it could go no farther.”</p>

<p>“No, what I meant,” explained Jerry, “was,
did you pull the emergency air brake cord?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you mean this thing?” innocently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
asked the professor, indicating the cord to which
he was clinging with one hand. “Well, perhaps
I did give it a yank. I had to hold on to it, you
know, or else lose the jumping moth, and I did
not want to do that. Perhaps I may have jerked
the cord—this way——” and he was about to pull
it again, when the conductor yelled:</p>

<p>“Don’t do that! Great Scott! The engineer
has nervous prostration now, and we don’t want
to scare him any more. Don’t pull that cord
again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” agreed the professor, gently.
“Will some one kindly give me a hand down? I
don’t want to lose the moth. But why did the
train stop so suddenly? Did we hit anything?”</p>

<p>“You stopped it,” explained Jerry, as he
helped his friend down. “You put on the brakes
when you pulled that cord.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” asked the scientist, innocently.
“How odd! Well, I won’t do it again. Now
to take care of my prize.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be grub-staked!” ejaculated
Harvey Brill, and as the conductor gave the engineer
the signal to go ahead again, our party of
friends returned to their seats, while trainmen
went about explaining to the other passengers the
cause of the emergency stop.</p>

<p>For that was what is was. On most trains there
is a red cord, in addition to the one that communicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with an air whistle in the engineer’s
cab. The pulling of this red cord automatically
sets the air brakes, and, in supporting himself
under the “hood,” or overhanging part of the
vestibule of the coach, the professor had, by accident,
pulled this cord. Of course the brakes
went on quickly, and confusion resulted.</p>

<p>But no great harm was done, save to delay the
train somewhat, and when the cause was explained
no one blamed the innocent and absent-minded
scientist. As for himself, he thought no more of
the occurrence, being so busy putting the jumping
moth in a box, and making notes concerning his
prize. Then he began reading something about
the luminous snakes from a book he carried.</p>

<p>Another day’s travel, during which they ate on
the train, sleeping at night in comfortable berths,
brought them to where they changed to the Great
Northern Railroad.</p>

<p>“And now we’re beginning the last stage of our
trip,” explained Jerry, who had been studying the
route and timetables. “We’ll soon be in Kabspell.”</p>

<p>“And nothing has happened—that is, nothing
much,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“The meals were pretty good,” observed Bob,
patting the region beneath his belt.</p>

<p>“Say, is that all you think of?” demanded
Ned. “I meant that nothing troublesome had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
happened. We haven’t been followed, and no
suspicious characters seem to be spying on us.”</p>

<p>“Not since I got rid of that distant aunt of
mine,” added Mr. Brill, with a sigh of relief.
“Say, if she ever finds out I’ve got money I’ll
never have any peace. She’ll tell all the rest of
my poor relations, who seem to dislike work,
and it will be all up with me. So, even if we find
the sixty—I mean what we are after,” he hurriedly
corrected himself, “don’t let on that any
of it is mine—at least not while she’s around,”
and he glanced nervously about as though fearful
that the stout lady might somehow have followed
him. But she was not present.</p>

<p>The journey on the Great Northern was
pleasant traveling, and the boys went through a
wonderful bit of country. It seemed that their
journey was to be almost an uneventful one until,
near the very end of it, something occurred
that set them all on edge, and made the two
Westerners very uneasy.</p>

<p>In accordance with their plan, Professor Snodgrass
was spoken of as the ostensible head of the
expedition, and to all who engaged our friends
in conversation the impression was given that the
capture of some rare snakes, as well as other
specimens, was the object. The professor’s
character naturally bore out this, especially after
his stopping of the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s get out here and stretch our legs,” suggested
Ned, when they reached the junction of
the Great Northern line with the Great Falls
and Canada Railroad.</p>

<p>“Yes, we haven’t far to travel now,” observed
Mr. Brill. “We’ve been in Montana for some
time. We’re not far from the Canadian border,
and in a little while we’ll be at the Blackfeet
Indian Reservation. From here it’s only about
seventy-five miles to Kabspell, but the grades are
rather steep. We won’t make very good time.”</p>

<p>“I only hope our airship is there,” said Jerry.
“Once we get that together, and in working
order, we’ll be independent of grades and railroads.”</p>

<p>As their train was to stop some little time they
walked about to vary the monotony of riding in
the cars. The professor, of course, no sooner
found himself on “<i>terra-cotta</i>,” as Bob expressed
it, than he began hunting for specimens.</p>

<p>As the boys entered the station, to look about,
they saw sitting in the corner a roughly dressed
man, evidently a miner. He had a scar on his
face. And Jerry, who was always on the lookout
for anyone who might be regarded as an enemy,
saw the fellow start as he caught a glimpse of
Harvey Brill.</p>

<p>Without seeming to do so, the tall lad whispered
to the prospector, calling his attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the suspicious character, and asking Mr. Brill
if he had ever seen him before.</p>

<p>Stealing a casual glance at the stranger, Mr.
Brill whispered back:</p>

<p>“Never saw him before, so far as I know. If
he’s one of the grub-stakers I don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m mistaken,” agreed Jerry; “but
he seemed some excited when he first got a
glimpse of you. I guess it’s all right, though.
Anyhow, I hope so.”</p>

<p>He and the others went out of the station, and
the man, after a glance at the retreating forms,
slid up to the ticket window.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll change my destination, partner,”
he said to the man behind the wicket. “I’ll
travel on the Great Northern instead of on the
Great Falls. Can you swap tickets for me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so,” grumbled the agent.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only some friends of mine are going
that way, and I guess I’ll trail along. I’ve
been waiting some time for them to show up, and,
now that they’re here I don’t like to lose ’em.
Just switch tickets for me.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that, as Jerry and his
friends boarded their train again, they were unaware
of the fact that the suspicious character—the
man with the scar—was riding in the smoking
car behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I’m on the right trail,” murmured
the man who had changed his tickets. “It’s him
all right, from the description, though I don’t
know what he’s doing with them boys, and the
little man with the bald head, who seems to be
after mosquitoes all the while. And that other
chap, too. He’s a Westerner, or I miss my guess.
Well, we’ll see what happens,” and he settled
himself comfortably back in the seat, and looked

<p>“Here you go, Bob, hand me that monkey
wrench.”</p>

<p>“It’s right behind you, Jerry. Say, though,
I’ve forgotten whether these side planes, or the
rear ones, go on first.”</p>

<p>“The rear ones, of course,” spoke Ned. “We
won’t put the side planes on until last, and then
they won’t interfere. Look out, don’t step in that
pile of bolts. I’ve got ’em arranged in the order
I want to use ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t,” and the stout lad changed the
planes he had taken up, selecting another set.</p>

<p>“Who’s got the hammer?” demanded Jerry,
a little later.</p>

<p>“You had it last,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“I did not. You sang out for it and I fired it
over to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’d forgotten. I’ve got it.
Now, boys, get a move on, and we’ll soon have
her in shape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the third day after the arrival of our
heroes and their friends in the small town of
Kabspell, Montana, and they were busy assembling
their motorship, which had arrived
safely a short time before.</p>

<p>They had secured a boarding place, and had
arranged to use an old shed on the outskirts of
the town as a “hangar” in which to assemble
the parts of their craft. They found everything
all right, save that one of the hydroplane floats
had been smashed, but a local carpenter had
agreed to make another.</p>

<p>The arrival of the lads and the mysterious
craft had created no little astonishment in the
town, and such a crowd assembled in and about
the shed that the motor boys were forced to put
up ropes, and hire a man to keep back the throng,
so they would have room to work.</p>

<p>“We don’t mind them watching us,” said Jerry;
“but we don’t want to step on them all the while,
and they will insist on fingering things. First we
know, some part will be missing, and then we’ll
be in a pretty fix.”</p>

<p>Jim Nestor and Harvey Brill offered their aid
in reassembling the motorship, and their services
were gladly accepted. One or two mechanics had
also been hired to fit the motor and gas machine
together, as the boys found themselves pretty
well occupied. But, for the most part, the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
did the work themselves. They were familiar
with their craft, and knew just how to put it together,
having taken it apart several times.</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do?” inquired Professor
Snodgrass, as he entered the shed on the
morning when the activities of the lads brought
forth the utterances with which I began this
chapter. “I’d like to help,” went on the little
bald-headed scientist, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” said Jerry, winking at
Ned. “We won’t take you from your researches.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, as long as you don’t want me,”
proceeded the “bugologist,” gladly, “I’ll see if
I can locate a side-stepping toad. I saw traces of
one not long ago.”</p>

<p>“A side-stepping toad!” exclaimed Bob.
“That’s a new one.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t good to eat, though, Chunky!”
chuckled Ned, taking care to get out of reach of
his fat chum.</p>

<p>“But what is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a toad that moves sideways, like a
crab,” explained the scientist. “They are very
rare, and only a few museums have them. I
shall count myself fortunate if I find one—almost
as fortunate as if I get a luminous serpent.
By the way, when shall we be able to start for
them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“In a few days,” replied Jerry; and then the
professor went out. “I’m glad he didn’t insist
on wanting to help,” he added to Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s right. The last time he did he fitted
the exhaust pipe to the gasoline intake, and we’d
have had a dandy explosion if we hadn’t seen it
in time.”</p>

<p>“And before that,” commented the tall lad,
“he had the elevation rudder rigged up so that
we’d have shot downward instead of going up.
He did it before I found out what he was up to.
No, the professor is a fine man, but what he
doesn’t know about an airship would fill a few
books. Now, Ned, if you’ll give me a hand we’ll
connect the gasoline tank to the motor, and then
fit up the pilot house controls.”</p>

<p>The boys and their helpers were busily engaged
that afternoon when a man, who, somehow,
had made his way past the guard, sauntered
into the shed.</p>

<p>“When do you fellers calculate on givin’ th’
circus?” he drawled.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a circus,” replied Jerry, hoping the
fellow was not going to be annoyingly curious.</p>

<p>“No? Wa’al, you’re goin’ t’ give an exhibition;
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll let the people see us fly, of course,
when we get ready,” answered the tall lad, good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fly? Do you really mean t’ say you folks
are goin’ up in that thing?” asked the man, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve done it many times before this,
and if all goes right we’ll do it again,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“Great Peter!” cried the man. “I thought
it was only a model t’ look at. An’ you’re really
goin’ t’ fly?”</p>

<p>“We sure are,” said Jerry. “Here, Ned,
just hold this bolt, while I tighten the nut, will
you?”</p>

<p>“What does this handle do?” asked the man,
as he pulled one of the many levers.</p>

<p>“That works the elevating rudder,” replied
Jerry. “Please don’t touch it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the man, good-naturedly.
“But what are you folks aimin’ t’ do when you
do get your shebang together?”</p>

<p>It was the question the boys had been anticipating
ever since they arrived in Kabspell, and
they were ready for it.</p>

<p>“Did you see that small man—the one with
no hair on his head?” asked Jerry, with a wink
at his chums.</p>

<p>“The one I passed as I was comin’ in? Yes,
I saw him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he wants to get a lot of queer bugs—insects—snakes
and the like,” went on Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
“He’s a professor in a big college—a bug collector.
We’re with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” exclaimed the man, as if much
disappointed. “I calculated you were prospectors,
or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Why, is there gold out here?” asked Jerry,
as innocently as he could.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, there is for them as knows where it
is,” spoke the man with a sharp look at the boys
and the two Westerners. But our friends did
not betray themselves—at least they hoped they
did not.</p>

<p>The work went on apace, and soon the inquisitive
man was peering about at another part
of the airship.</p>

<p>“What’s this wheel for?” he asked. As he
spoke he gave it a turn, and at once a series of
thunderous explosions followed—like a battery
of machine guns going off.</p>

<p>“Great Peter!” cried the man, and with one
jump he leaped through an open window of the
shed, and, running across the field, he yelled:</p>

<p>“She’s going to blow up! Skedaddle, everybody!”</p>

<p>The crowd, which was always assembled about
the shed, turned to flee, but the explosions suddenly
ceased.</p>

<p>“What was it?” cried Bob, seeing that there
was no danger. He and Ned had run for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
engine room, in which Jerry had been working
when the man meddled with the wheel.</p>

<p>“Oh, that fellow started the motor, and the
muffler wasn’t attached,” answered the tall lad.
“No damage done. I stopped her in time. But
maybe it will teach him a lesson.”</p>

<p>It seemed to, for the fellow did not come
back. Instead, he went to a certain resort in the
town, and there he met a man with a long scar
on his face—a livid scar.</p>

<p>“Well, did you find out anything?” asked
the man with the scar. “Did you get next, Ike
Weldon?”</p>

<p>“All I found out, Jake Paxton, was that they’re
hunting for bugs—as if they couldn’t get enough
without lookin’ for ’em. That’s what they told
me, and then th’ shebang blew up!”</p>

<p>“Blew up—how?”</p>

<p>“Well, I monkeyed with it, I guess,” and Ike
Weldon told of the results of his visit.</p>

<p>“Say, you’re a pretty one to send to get information!”
exclaimed Jake, with contempt. “I
thought you knew your business!”</p>

<p>“I do. They’re after bugs, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. They wouldn’t come away
out here with an airship for that. I’ll have to
fix up some sort of a disguise and go myself.
They saw me at the Junction, where I changed
my ticket, and they might know me. But I’m sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that’s the man we want to keep track of—that
biggest Westerner. I’ll go around there myself
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t go to handling anything, or you
might get blown up too,” advised his crony.
“Hello!” he exclaimed, suddenly. “Here
comes that other chap from the East—the one
who arrived a few days ago—Nixon his name is.
Maybe he knows something about these chaps.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can get him to talk,” remarked
Jake. “I think I’m on the right trail, and just
as soon as some of the other boys get here I’ll
make sure of it. They know Harvey Brill, and
I don’t—only by description. Yes, I’ll see what
I can get out of this Nixon chap.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>OFF IN THE MOTORSHIP</small></h2>


<p>“Well, Jerry, do you think we can soon give
her a trial?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we’ll chance it to-morrow, if the
weather is good. The winds are pretty high in
this region, and I don’t want to run any risks
until I know I’ve got the <i>Comet</i> well under control.
But I guess we’ll have a trial flight to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was about a week after their arrival in
Kabspell, and the time had been occupied in reassembling
their craft. The work had gone on
well, and they had not been further annoyed by
any visits from the man who so unexpectedly
started the motor that day. True, others had
sought to gain admission to the shed, but the man
on guard had been told to be very strict, and no
more strangers had been admitted.</p>

<p>“It’s queer we haven’t run across Noddy
Nixon, or Bill Berry, since we arrived,” remarked
Bob, as he came from the kitchen of the
motorship, where he had been getting the electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
stove in readiness for cooking meals when they
should be aloft. The craft was still in the shed,
but would soon be ready to be wheeled out and
sent skyward.</p>

<p>“Maybe he didn’t come here after all,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe he did,” declared Jerry.
“Noddy isn’t the kind of a fellow to give up
when he sees a chance to annoy us. I believe he
found out, in some way, that we were coming
here; and he suspects what for. If he hasn’t
shown himself it’s because he doesn’t want us
to see him.”</p>

<p>“And there are a lot of strangers in town,”
went on Bob. “There have been rumors of a
rich strike somewhere out this way, and the
miners are just pouring into Kabspell.”</p>

<p>“I hope none of my old grub-stakers get here,”
spoke Harvey Brill. “I’m not afraid of ’em, but
I don’t want to get you boys into trouble if I can
help it.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll be ready for it if it comes,” said
Jerry, confidently. “Once we get off in the
<i>Comet</i> they’ll have their own troubles following
us.”</p>

<p>They worked hard that day, and spent most
of the morning putting the finishing touches to
their craft. Professor Snodgrass went about as
his fancy dictated, making strange and odd captures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
at intervals. If he did not find the side-stepping
toad at least he was hopeful of soon
finding the luminous snakes.</p>

<p>It was not far to the border valley where the
boys hoped to locate not only the queer serpents,
but also the sixty nuggets of gold. Truth to
tell, they were getting anxious for the real search
to begin.</p>

<p>The last bolts had been screwed into place,
the final adjustments made, the tanks were filled
with gasoline, the electrical connections were all
made, and the gas machine was in readiness to
produce the powerful lifting vapor when needed.
The extra mechanics had been paid off, and, true
to his prediction, Jerry was ready to give the
motorship a trial.</p>

<p>“Where are you going in her?” asked Ned,
as he and his chums made some final tests of the
mechanism.</p>

<p>“Oh, nowhere in particular. I just thought
we’d go up a way, circle about, maybe descend on
Flathead Lake and then come back here. We
may find she needs a little tuning up. After we
give her that we can stock our lockers, and start
for the Border.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mr. Brill, and Jim Nestor
echoed the words.</p>

<p>A great crowd had assembled, for, somehow,
word had gone forth that the motorship was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
make a flight. Most of the men—for there were
only a few women—were openly incredulous. As
the craft was wheeled from the shed a lad in the
throng cried:</p>

<p>“Watch ’em sail—not!”</p>

<p>“They’ll never get that off the ground!” declared
several.</p>

<p>“That’s right. She’s too heavy. Might as
well try to go above the clouds in a wash-tub, or
a pair of rubber boots.”</p>

<p>Indeed the <i>Comet</i> did look rather big and
heavy, but the crowd did not know the power
that lay in the great propellers, or in the lifting
gas.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums went carefully over every
bit of machinery. The two Westerners were in
their places, a trifle anxious. Professor Snodgrass
had been induced to give up his bug-hunting
long enough to go aboard for the trial.</p>

<p>The scientist was now in the main cabin, calmly
making notes about his captures, as oblivious of
his surroundings and the curious throng in the
field, as if he was in his library at home.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Jerry of Ned, taking his
place in the pilot house.</p>

<p>“All ready,” was the low answer.</p>

<p>“Then let her go!”</p>

<p>There was a splutter of sparks, a grinding
sound, a series of explosions, and then a whirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
noise as the great propeller blades began to revolve,
slowly at first and then with a speed that
made them mere blurs of light.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> began to move slowly over the
smooth ground.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed many in the crowd.
“We knew she wouldn’t go up!”</p>

<p>But, hardly had they spoken, when Jerry tilted
the elevation rudder. With a sweep and a
swoop, the great motorship left the earth, shot
over the heads of the crowd—the nearest ones
instinctively ducking, though there was no need—and
a few seconds later the airship was sailing
majestically toward the clouds.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Bob. “We’re off again!”</p>

<p>For a moment the startled throng was silent,
and then, as before their very eyes the seemingly
impossible feat had been accomplished, they set
up a great cheer, which came faintly to the ears
of the motor boys.</p>

<p>“And now for the valley of the sixty nuggets
of gold!” exclaimed Mr. Brill, there being none
but friends to hear him.</p>

<p>“Not quite yet,” said Jerry, with a smile;
“She needs a little adjusting before she answers
to her rudders perfectly. But we can do that to-morrow,
stock up the next day and set off.”</p>

<p>Before going back to their improvised “hangar,”
however, they went out to Flathead Lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
where they settled down to the surface of the
water to give the hydroplanes a trial. They
worked well, the new one being as good as the
others.</p>

<p>Then back again over the heads of the astonished,
waiting throng they sailed, to settle
down as gracefully as a bird in front of the shed.</p>

<p>“Simon’s grandmother!” gasped one of the
formerly skeptical men. “I never thought they
could do it! Never!”</p>

<p>While Jerry spent most of the next day in
making some necessary changes, his chums saw to
the stocking of the craft with food and supplies,
for they did not know how long they would be on
the Border.</p>

<p>It was quite windy the morning set for the
start, but Jerry, after a dubious look at the clouds,
decided that they would delay no longer.</p>

<p>“We may strike a calm zone up above,” he
said.</p>

<p>The last preparations were made, and with
the motor boys and their friends aboard the
<i>Comet</i>, Jerry gave the word to start. Once
more came that nerve-thrilling rush across the
ground, and then the quick ascent into the air.
Again the crowd cheered, waving their hats and
even jumping up and down in an ecstasy of wonder
at something they had heard of, but never before
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they’re off, Ike,” remarked a man with
a scar on his face, to another man in the crowd.
“Now I wonder if we can trail ’em?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t going to be easy on horses, and yet
that Nixon chap claims to know about where
they’ll head for.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he said he wanted to keep under cover,—claimed
they’d make trouble if they saw him.
He’ll meet us on the main road just outside of
town.”</p>

<p>“All right, come on then,” and the man with
the scar and his confederate leaped on their horses
and galloped off, taking as nearly as they could
the course of the airship above them. A little
later they were joined by a third person.</p>

<p>Bob, in the kitchen of the aircraft, with nothing
to do until it came time to get dinner, took up a
pair of field glasses and focussed them on the
earth below. They were well away from the
crowd now, and Bob caught sight of three figures
on horses, seemingly racing below them.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” he murmured. “It looks as
if they were trying to follow us. And—and—why,
if that isn’t Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>He looked eagerly through the glasses and
then called to Jerry, who, setting the automatic
steering gear, came back to the galley on
a run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t that Noddy?” demanded Bob, in great
excitement.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed the tall lad, after a look.
“And one of the men is that same chap we saw in
the depot—the one I suspected of being a grub-staker!
Fellows, we’re being followed! But I
don’t believe they can keep it up long!”</p>

<small>A FRIGHTENED SETTLEMENT</small></h2>


<p>Silence greeted the announcement of Jerry
Hopkins, and for a few moments all gazed downward
on the horsemen below them—that is, all
but Professor Snodgrass. It would need something
more than this to take him away from his
notebooks.</p>

<p>“Just show ’em that we don’t care about ’em,”
proposed Ned. “Scoot down toward ’em, Jerry,
and then speed up for all you’re worth. We can
easily leave ’em behind.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Bob. “You do
that, and I’ll see about getting something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Something to eat!” exclaimed Jim Nestor.
“Why, we had breakfast only a little while ago.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Chunky,” said Jerry, with
a smile. “From now on he’s going to live in the
cooking galley.”</p>

<p>“I am not!” indignantly exclaimed the stout
lad. “And if I did, I guess you fellows would
be glad of it, for you’re generally as hungry as
I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Chunky, we’ll forgive you,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“But, how about fooling Noddy, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t do any harm. Here goes.”</p>

<p>He went back to the engine room, and while
the others in the party watched those below them,
who sought to get on the trail of the sixty nuggets
of gold, Jerry sent the <i>Comet</i> down until
they could hear the excited shouts of one of the
horsemen with Noddy.</p>

<p>“That’s the grub-staker!” exclaimed Ned.
“He doesn’t know much about airships, and I
guess he thinks we’re going to smash into him.”</p>

<p>“Noddy and Bill are taking it calmly enough,”
observed the tall lad, as indeed the two plotters
were, for they could be seen gazing up at the
motorship as if they knew its power and what it
would do. But the other man was yelling excitedly,
and urging his steed to one side.</p>

<p>The motor boys were too far away to permit
them to hear what was being said, but it was
evident that Noddy and Bill were trying to reassure
their companion.</p>

<p>“Now show ’em our heels!” cried Ned and,
as Jerry set the motor to full speed ahead, the
<i>Comet</i> leaped forward on an upward slant and
soon was but a speck in the sky, while the disappointed
horsemen tried in vain to follow its
flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ve given us the slip!” exclaimed Bill
Berry.</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ve seen in what direction they
started,” declared Noddy. “And you know the
best place to head for; don’t you?” he asked of
the other man.</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” replied the grub-staker. “But
I never thought they could handle an airship so.
Why, they might ram us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy enough to handle one of those
things,” spoke Noddy, half contemptuously. “I
have done it.” But in his own heart he knew he
had never managed a craft with the skill of the
motor boys.</p>

<p>Our friends continued on their upward flight
until they lost sight of the horsemen, and they
knew they, themselves, must be but a mere speck
in the sky.</p>

<p>“Now let ’em follow—if they can!” exclaimed
Jerry, as he set the automatic steering gear.
“How about that grub you spoke of, Bob?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be ready soon. What did I tell you?”
demanded the vindicated stout lad, with a laugh.
“I said you’d be hungry as soon as I was.”</p>

<p>“Well, this high altitude—ahem!” laughed
the tall lad. “Serve it up, Bob!” he added, with
assumed dignity.</p>

<p>During the meal they talked over their plans,
and it was decided, first of all, to stick to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
original scheme of pretending to be attached to
the professor’s scientific party.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to Bolton,” said Jim Nestor.
“That’s the nearest settlement of any account
this side of the Border, and near the valley you
spoke of, Harvey.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess Bolton would be the best place,”
assented the prospector. “I was there just before
I made my strike, and from there I can lay
out the course to the valley. There’s only one
thing bothering me, though.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Well, you see the only way I can locate that
valley is by the landmarks on the surface. There
are two or three things by which I could tell when
I got to the head of it. But, being up in the air
this way, I don’t see how I’m going to recognize
’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be easy,” asserted Jerry. “We
can make a descent whenever we want to, and
look about. If you see any signs that would tell
us we were near the valley, then we can rise above
the hills again, and move along until we are
hovering over the big gash. Then we can drop
down into it.”</p>

<p>“Drop down into it!” exclaimed the prospector,
for he had not yet gotten used to hearing
Jerry and the others speaking so naturally of a
“drop” from the clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that is, drop gently,” explained Jerry,
with a smile.</p>

<p>This plan appealed to all as a good one, and it
was adopted. That day they skimmed along, not
going at any great speed after they had left Noddy
and his cronies behind. At night, to prevent being
blown too far off their course, in case a wind
should spring up, they descended into a little valley,
where they anchored. Harvey Brill recognized
the place as one where he had once prospected
without results.</p>

<p>“We’re not many miles, as the crow flies, from
the Border valley,” said the old prospector, as he
looked about him; “though it took me a good
while to make that distance, traveling on
foot.”</p>

<p>The night passed uneventfully, but, when
morning dawned, they found that a stiff gale was
blowing. Sheltered as they were, they did not
realize the strength of it, but, when they ascended,
the <i>Comet</i> was almost pitched on her
“beam ends” once she was above the shelter of
the hills.</p>

<p>“Say, this is fierce!” cried Ned, who was in
the pilot house, helping Jerry, while Bob attended
to the engine room. “We’d better go down,
Jerry!”</p>

<p>“I think so—myself!” panted the tall lad,
struggling to pull over the lever of the deflecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
rudder. “I want to—but this is stuck!” he cried.
“It’s gotten jammed in some way!”</p>

<p>“What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Scud along—that’s the only chance until the
wind slackens. Then, when there isn’t so much
pressure on the planes, I can work the rudder.”</p>

<p>And scud they did, their speed being increased
by the power of the wind. They were not flying
high, and Jerry dared not send the craft up any
farther for fear of getting into a still breezier
stratum of air.</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t hit anything!” he murmured,
as he watched the speed and pressure gauges in
the pilot house. Ned stood beside him, ready to
help, and Jim Nestor had been pressed into service
in the motor room. The professor was, as
usual, busy over his books, and Harvey Brill was
moving restlessly about, half fearing the danger
he knew surrounded them.</p>

<p>It was about noon when Ned, who was looking
from the forward port of the pilot house, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Jerry, I think we’ll have to go up whether we
want to or not. There’s a big cliff just ahead of
us, and we’re heading right for it.”</p>

<p>Jerry sprang to his chum’s side, and quickly
made some calculations.</p>

<p>“I think we can just about clear it,” he said.
“If we can, so much the better, for I have a notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that it’s blowing great guns higher up. I
think we can clear it.”</p>

<p>He and Ned watched anxiously, their hands on
the levers ready to send the <i>Comet</i> up if necessary.
But, as they approached the cliff, they saw
that they could clear it by a small margin.</p>

<p>“And a good thing, too,” declared Jerry, with
a glance aloft at the scudding clouds.</p>

<p>They crossed the pinnacle of the small mountain,
and on the other side, saw, stretched before
them, a level plain. On the far edge could be
made out a small village or settlement.</p>

<p>“There’s Bolton!” exclaimed Jim Nestor.
“We’re near the Border now!”</p>

<p>On rushed the <i>Comet</i>, and, as it came nearer
the town, under better control now, for the wind
had fallen off somewhat, a curious scene was presented.
There was an outpouring of men and a
few women—a horde of horsemen, and all gathered
in a compact mass to watch the oncoming
motorship.</p>

<p>As it approached nearer, cries of wonder could
be heard, and then, as the craft swept straight for
the settlement, with Jerry in the pilot house looking
for a smooth place to make a landing, the
whole population turned, and fled as though some
pursuing demon was after them.</p>

<p>“They’re scared out of their wits!” cried Ned.
“I guess they never saw an airship before.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE BLACKFEET</small></h2>


<p>With the airship rushing onward, those
aboard it looked at the strange sight below them.
In a few seconds they were fairly over the heads
of the scampering populace, and, as the dim
shadow of the aircraft fell on them, several
women screamed with fright, and a number of
men drew their big revolvers.</p>

<p>“This won’t do!” cried Jerry. “We don’t
want a lot of bullet holes in the gas bag,” for it
was partly inflated. “Hi!” he yelled, leaning
out of the pilot house window, as he shut off the
motor to make his words heard. “You’re in no
danger! Don’t be afraid! Don’t shoot! It’s
all right, we’re going to land!”</p>

<p>“What is it? Oh, what is it?” cried one
woman, clinging to her husband.</p>

<p>“Bless me if I know,” he replied. “Maybe it’s
the end of the world.”</p>

<p>“This is an airship—an aeroplane—a balloon!”
yelled Jerry, as he signalled to Ned to
volplane to earth. “You must have seen pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of ’em—read about ’em!” he went on. “We’re
only an airship!”</p>

<p>This served, in a measure, to calm the fears of
most of those who were racing over the plain.
They slowed up, and, as the <i>Comet</i> came to rest
on the ground, rolling along on the wheels, the
crowd saw that there was no danger. Some
even ventured to approach closer.</p>

<p>“I have seen pictures of the contraptions,”
said one man, slowly; “but they didn’t look nothin’
like this shebang!”</p>

<p>“Well, this is somewhat different,” explained
Jerry, as he and his party alighted.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t no notion that they made as much
racket as that, neither,” spoke another man.</p>

<p>“And they come on you lickity split,” spoke a
third. “I thought hosses had t’ pull ’em, or
suthin’ like that.”</p>

<p>By this time the throng had approached still
nearer and even the most timid now ventured to
inspect the curious craft that had so suddenly, and
strangely, appeared in their midst. Later the
boys learned that Bolton was so remote from the
ordinary line of travel, and that its inhabitants
had so few opportunities of looking at the newspapers
or magazines, that few, if any of them,
had a real idea of what an airship was like. Consequently
the sudden appearance of the <i>Comet</i>
was enough to startle even the bravest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>But the boys were made welcome, and were
asked to partake of the hospitality of the place.
There was in Bolton what passed for a hotel, but
Bob whispered:</p>

<p>“We can get better meals ourselves than they
can serve. Let’s stick to the ship.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right, Chunky,” assented
Jerry. “We will.”</p>

<p>Once the first fright and curiosity was over, the
minds of the villagers naturally turned to the object
that had brought the voyagers in their midst.
By this time Professor Snodgrass had put aside
his note books, and was stalking along through
the crowd, looking for rare insects. Approaching
one burly miner the scientist exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ha! Now I have him!”</p>

<p>“Hold on! No, you don’t! Hands up!”
cried the miner, and the next instant the little professor
was gazing unflinchingly down the muzzle
of a big revolver. “Don’t you lay a hand on
me!” went on the miner. “I’ve got the drop on
you! Besides, you can’t extradite me for a crime
like that, anyhow. And, anyhow, I didn’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Do it? Do what?” asked the professor
mildly. “Will you please put down that gun.
It’s in my way, and I want to catch a new specimen
of a blue spotted lizard I see crawling on
your coat.”</p>

<p>“A lizard!” gasped the man, as he lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
his weapon. “Aren’t you a sheriff, looking for
me?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the professor, with a smile.
“I am collecting specimens for my college museum.
Ah, there! I have it—just a moment, if
you please,” and with a quick motion he captured
the wriggling lizard in a little net, and transferred
it to one of his glass boxes.</p>

<p>“Is—is that what you’re after?” asked the
man, backing away, while those near him laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said the professor, blandly.</p>

<p>“We’re a scientific expedition,” put in Jerry,
thinking this a good time to explain the nature of
the trip. “We are all with Professor Snodgrass,
after specimens,” but he did not say what kind,
and, after all, the sixty nuggets were specimens of
one sort.</p>

<p>“Huh!” ejaculated the man, as he put away
his weapon. “I took you for a sheriff when you
tackled me that way. It’s a good thing you aren’t,
for I had the drop on you. But anyhow,” he
added quickly, “I didn’t do anything. It was another
fellow.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” said Mr. Snodgrass, as
he made some notes about the blue spotted lizard.
“And now can you tell me where I can find some
luminous snakes?”</p>

<p>“Luminous snakes?” ejaculated the man.
“Say, let me out of this. First it’s blue lizards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and now it’s luminous snakes! I wonder if you’re
crazy, or I am,” and he made his way through
the throng.</p>

<p>The airship was now attracting much attention,
and when Bob began preparing a meal in the galley
the crowd was so great that they threatened to
overturn the craft in their eagerness. So Jerry
and his chums stretched a rope about the <i>Comet</i>,
and after that they had more seclusion.</p>

<p>They did not intend to stay in Bolton long,
merely to wait for the gale to subside, and to look
over the craft for possible damage. None was
in evidence, and, while Jerry was ascertaining
this, Jim Nestor and Harvey Brill went about the
town. They saw no one they knew, for which
Mr. Brill was glad, as he did not want to have to
answer embarrassing questions.</p>

<p>“And I don’t see any of the grub-stakers,
either,” he said; “though some of ’em who got
on my trail did hang out here.”</p>

<p>It began to look as if they could start on their
way to the Border, and their search for the golden
valley, without being annoyed by men who would
stop at nothing to accomplish their ends. As for
Noddy Nixon and his cronies, nothing more had
been seen of them.</p>

<p>“We’ll start for the Border to-morrow,” decided
Jerry, after a day spent in Bolton, during
which the professor got many new specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The boys and the two men, in order to give color
to their pretended characters, assisted the scientist
in getting specimens, though Mr. Snodgrass
laughed at the varieties they brought in.</p>

<p>“I have them all—every one,” he said. “You
must learn to look for new and rare kinds.”</p>

<p>The people of Bolton were sorry to see our
friends leave, but as the weather was now good,
Jerry decided that it was useless to remain longer.
Accordingly the <i>Comet</i> was sent aloft, and steered
for the Canadian Border.</p>

<p>“Keep watch for your landmarks,” Jerry cautioned
the old prospector. “We’ll go down when
you spot one and see if we can trace the valley in
that way.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the answer.</p>

<p>They crossed the Border early that day, flying
low enough to recognize the stone posts that in
places marked the Northern limits of the United
States, and the Southern line of Canada.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to work more to the East, to my
way of thinking,” said Mr. Brill, after several
hours of coasting back and forth over the line.
“The valley lies more to the East.”</p>

<p>Jerry accordingly changed the rudder. They
were proceeding along at a good rate of speed,
when there came a sudden snapping sound and the
<i>Comet</i> seemed to swing about almost in a circle.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rudder control is broken!” cried Jerry.
“We’ll have to go down. Shut off the motor,
Ned. Bob, start the gas machine!”</p>

<p>Below them was an almost unbroken wilderness,
but Jerry managed to pick out a little clearing,
and guided the craft to that as best he could.</p>

<p>As the <i>Comet</i> settled down, and the boys and
their companions leaped out to see the extent of
the damage, there was a commotion in the woods
surrounding them. Then, to their surprise, <a href="#image01">there
stalked into the little clearing a number of Indians</a>,
attired in their beads, feathers and blankets.</p>

<p>“Blackfeet!” exclaimed Harvey Brill, in a low
voice. “They’re a party of Blackfeet from the
reservation! They must have taken French leave.
Now there’ll be trouble!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>BEAR STEAKS</small></h2>


<p>For a moment the two parties remained watching
each other narrowly—on one side the whites,
and on the other the Indians, who surrounded,
and far outnumbered our friends. The redmen
were wrapped in their blankets, and they did not
show a weapon, though it could hardly be doubted
but that, under the gaudy folds, they carried rifles
surreptitiously obtained.</p>

<p>“What’s best to do?” asked Jerry, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what they’re going to do, first,”
suggested Jim Nestor. “It’s too bad we jumped
out so suddenly, without even a pistol. And if we
make a move to get ’em now it will only start the
trouble all the sooner. If we can get along
peaceably so much the better. I don’t hanker for
a fight.”</p>

<p>The Blackfeet must have been wonderfully astonished
to see such a strange craft descend so
suddenly among them, but, with the characteristics
of their race, they maintained a dignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
silence, save for a few grunts, and an occasional
low-voiced remark.</p>

<p>“I guess they take us for visitors from the
clouds,” said Ned, in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” replied Jim. “I
shouldn’t be surprised if some of them had seen
an airship before.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Bob, half incredulously.</p>

<p>“Why, sometimes the government gives permission
to the Indians to go out in traveling Wild
West shows, and often at the exhibitions there’ll
be an airship flight. Some of the Indians may
have seen one, and come back to tell the others
about it. In that case they wouldn’t show much
surprise. But, at the same time, if they had
never seen one, and if we should suddenly sprout
wings, and begin flying about ourselves, they
wouldn’t show any curiosity. It’s part of their
training, I guess.”</p>

<p>But now, after the first shock of what must have
been a surprise was over, the Indians seemed disposed
to be friendly enough. They evidently saw
that the party of whites was unarmed—at least
they had no weapons in their hands, though the
Indians did, as the boys and their friends could
see when a breeze blew their blankets aside, disclosing
the stocks of rifles held under the gay coverings.</p>

<p>One of the Blackfeet—evidently the leader—approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the group of whites who stood in
front of the airship, and, holding up his hand,
with the palm outward, an almost universal sign
of peace, gravely uttered one word:</p>

<p>“How!”</p>

<p>“How!” replied Harvey Brill, and then, to
the no small surprise of the boys, the old miner
began a string of guttural words that caused the
faces of the Indians to light up. They were being
addressed in their own tongue.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you could sling Blackfeet talk,”
said Jim, when his partner had finished.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not much good at it, but I can manage
to carry on a little conversation. It’s just as
I expected, these chaps have left the reservation.
They say they don’t like it there—too small,—and
they want to live freer. They’re out for a
good time.”</p>

<p>“And does that mean trouble for us?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, it may and it may not. The Indians
have been cooped up for a long time, and they’ve
lost much of their wildness. But it never all dies
out, and, once they feel that they are free—even
though they know they may be punished for what
they do—they may go on a rampage again—just
for fun, as they think.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to be careful,” suggested
Ned, who was eyeing the redmen with interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“We sure have. I’ve told ’em we’re after
bugs, and such like, but I don’t know whether they
believe it or not. There’s one thing sure, they’ll
never bother him,” and he pointed to Professor
Snodgrass, who, totally oblivious to his surroundings,
or any danger, was scurrying about, catching
bugs and specimens in his little nets.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Bob wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because they think he’s a little crazy—touched
in the head, you know. I heard some of
’em say so. The Indians—at least most of ’em—regard
a crazy person as particularly under the
protection of the Great Spirit, and they’ll never
harm one.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe we can get the professor to protect
us if worst comes to worst,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t imagine anything will happen
right away,” went on Harvey Brill. “They say
they are going off to hunt and fish, and all they
ask is to be let alone. That may be so, or it may
not. Time will tell. I’ve told ’em we are flying
about with the professor, and that we may disappear
any moment.”</p>

<p>“We can’t until that rudder’s fixed—worse
luck,” exclaimed Jerry. “We’ll get right at it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I wouldn’t delay any longer than I had
to,” spoke Jim Nestor. “Some of those fellows
are rather savage looking. I wouldn’t want to
anger one if I didn’t have a gun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are they much surprised at the <i>Comet</i>?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“They won’t let on, if they are,” replied the
miner.</p>

<p>The leader of the Blackfeet now addressed
Harvey Brill again, and, at the close of a short
conversation, the redmen, without any further
greetings, filed off in the woods.</p>

<p>“They say they’re going to look for hunting
and fishing grounds,” said the miner. “I only
hope they keep away.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have something to eat, anyhow!”
exclaimed Bob, with a sigh of relief, as the last
of the natives disappeared.</p>

<p>“That’s Bob’s remedy for every kind of
trouble,” cried Jerry, with a grin. “All right,
Chunky. You get the grub and I’ll see what I
can do with this rudder.”</p>

<p>Jerry found that it would take longer to fix
than he anticipated, as he had to unship it.</p>

<p>“We’ll be here three days, anyhow,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Then we might as well take it easy,” decided
Ned. “I wonder if we could do any hunting
around here?”</p>

<p>“I saw signs of bear when I was here before,”
said Harvey Brill. “I shouldn’t wonder but
what you might get a pop at one if you struck a
trail. I’ll go along if you like. With those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Blackfeet roaming around these woods I don’t
like you to take chances alone.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll stay here, and sort of keep on the
watch in camp,” said Jim, for they had made a
camp in the place where the airship had descended.</p>

<p>“And don’t let the professor wander too far
away,” cautioned Mr. Brill, as he and Ned prepared
to go on a hunt.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a good fire to cook any bear steaks,
if you bring in any,” said Bob. Jerry was left to
labor over the rudder. He needed only such help
as Bob or Jim Nestor could give.</p>

<p>Ned and Harvey Brill traveled on for some
miles without getting any sign of game. Then
the miner, who had been something of a hunter in
his day, came to a sudden stop, and, pointing to
the ground, said:</p>

<p>“There are the tracks, boy!”</p>

<p>“Bear?” asked Ned excitedly.</p>

<p>“That’s what! And they’re fresh, too!”</p>

<p>Cautiously they followed the trail, the tracks
becoming more pronounced each minute. Finally,
as they turned a rocky headland, they came to a
little glade, and there, feeding on some berry
bushes, they saw a large brown bear.</p>

<p>“Get him, boy!” exclaimed Harvey, generously
giving up his chance. “His back is toward
us, and the wind’s blowing from him to us. Plug
him right under the ear!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned felt himself beginning to tremble, but he
conquered the inclination, and raised his gun.
The muzzle wavered a bit, but he managed to
steady himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bear, as if some instinct warned
him of the presence of enemies, raised his head
and gave a loud “woof!” Instantly Ned fired,
and to his delight he saw bruin give a convulsive
leap into the air, and then whirl about, to fall a
moment later.</p>

<p>But, before the animal reached the ground
there was the report of another rifle at right angles
to where our friends stood, and a puff of
smoke told of the presence of another hunter.</p>

<p>“Someone else is after him!” exclaimed Harvey;
“but you winged him first, Ned! Come on,
he’s dead I guess!”</p>

<p>Together they sprang forward, but they had
hardly reached the carcass of the bear, which was
twitching in the death tremor, before there
stepped from the underbrush the Blackfeet Indian
leader. He held a smoking rifle in his hand,
and as he stalked forward he said with a scowl:</p>

<p>“Me shoot! That Indian bear!”</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried Mr. Brill. “Those are our
bear steaks! We shot him first!”</p>

<p>“Indian bear!” said the warrior, fiercely; and,
as he raised his hand, there came out from the
bushes several of his followers.</p>

<p>Ned Slade, who had started to run toward his
quarry, all excited over killing the bear, stopped
short at the sight of the party of redmen. Harvey
Brill, too, was plainly at a loss over what to
do.</p>

<p>“Indian bear!” repeated the leader of the
Blackfeet. It seemed that he could speak some
English, though previously he had talked only in
his own guttural tongue. “Indian shoot—Indian
bear,” he said, again scowling at our friends. The
other redmen gathered in a circle back of their
chief, and now it was noticed that they made no
pretense of having no arms—their rifles were
plainly in evidence.</p>

<p>“Guess we’re up against it, Mr. Brill,” murmured
Ned, as he raised his rifle, intending to
pump another cartridge into the firing chamber,
and eject the discharged shell.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” suddenly exclaimed the Westerner,
in a low but tense voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t what?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t pump in another charge. This is a
ticklish bit of work, Ned, and the least hostile act
may make trouble. Don’t load your gun, or some
of theirs may happen to go off—accidental-like.
Keep cool, and I’ll see what can be done.”</p>

<p>“But can he claim our bear—the bear I shot
before he did? There’s no doubt but that my
bullet struck first, and the bear was almost down
when he fired.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, my lad, but right doesn’t always
go in this country. They’ve got the numbers.
Still, I’m not going to give in without a kick. Of
course it’s your bear, and a fine shot it was, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brill looked narrowly at the Indian chief
and his followers. The redmen maintained a dignified
silence, seeming to prefer to leave it to their
leader to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>“Indian bear!” exclaimed the chief again, and
he took a step toward the carcass of bruin, as if
to see what the two whites would do toward disputing
his claim. “Indian bear!”</p>

<p>“So you said before, Standing Horse,” remarked
Harvey Brill, calmly. “I ought to know
it by this time. I’m not deaf. Only I don’t quite
agree with you.”</p>

<p>The miner, too, had dropped his jargon of Indian
talk, and was speaking in English, since he
saw that the redman used that tongue, though
how perfectly was yet to be learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bah! White man heap smart—boys smart
too. Come by eagle wings to get bear. Indian
shoot first.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so, and you know it, Standing
Horse!” exclaimed the miner, sharply. “We
did come by eagle wings out to this country, and
by that I suppose you mean our airship. But if
you think we came here to be cheated out of our
rights by you fellows, you’ve got another think
coming!”</p>

<p>“Bah! White man think much—talk much,”
half sneered the redman.</p>

<p>“Well, I always say what I think, which is
more than I can say about you, Standing Horse,
and them that’s with you,” retorted Harvey
Brill. “What makes you claim that bear as
yours? This young man here—and he owns part
of the eagle machine—he shot that bear as cleanly
as I ever want to see one toppled over. He fired
first, and it wasn’t until after the brute was falling
that you fired. Any of your men will say the
same thing, too, if they want to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“Indian always have straight tongue!” murmured
the chief, and some of his followers could
be heard to mutter as they gathered closer about
him.</p>

<p>“I wish they did!” snapped Mr. Brill. “But
it’s all nonsense for you to say that you killed the
bear. It’s ours and we mean to have it—not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
we actually need it, for I guess Bob has enough
grub in his kitchen to last a month. But we want
our rights, and we’re going to have ’em!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brill spoke sharply, and it was evident
that his words produced an effect on the Indians,
for they murmured angrily, and seemed to be
urging their chief to take some action.</p>

<p>“That Indian bear!” sullenly repeated Standing
Horse.</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the way you feel about it,
there’s only one way to settle this dispute!” declared
the miner. “Here, Ned, hold my gun!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked the lad.</p>

<p>“I’m going to prove to this cheating Indian
whose bullet it was that finished the bear. That’s
the only way. He’s got an old-fashioned rifle,
and it doesn’t make half the size wound your soft-nosed
mushroom bullet does. I’ll show him!”</p>

<p>Passing his rifle to Ned, Mr. Brill stalked forward
toward the body of the bear. At the first
sign of his advance the angry murmur among the
Indians increased, and the chief quickly shoved
another cartridge into the chamber of his weapon.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ned, in apprehension.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” answered the miner, reassuringly.
“I know these fellows. They won’t fire
until they’re more angry than they are now, and
especially when they see I haven’t got a gun.
Don’t worry. I’ll settle this thing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed that he was right, for when the redmen
saw that Harvey Brill had left his rifle with
Ned, their murmurs subsided, and the chief lowered
his gun.</p>

<p>“We’ll decide this right now, Standing Horse,”
went on the Westerner. “I’ll cut out the bullets
and prove to you that I’m right, and that this
young man killed the bear. Come on, now, be a
sport and take part in this post mortem examination.”</p>

<p>“White man sport—Indian sport!” said
the chief, and, not to be outdone in “bluff,”
Standing Horse passed his rifle to one of his followers
and joined Harvey at the dead bear.</p>

<p>The two stood for a moment over the carcass
of bruin, as though each was waiting for the action
of the other. Then Harvey motioned courteously
for the Indian to proceed to cut out the bullets to
satisfy himself.</p>

<p>“White man cut,” spoke Standing Horse,
briefly. It was a partial acknowledgment that
he would play fair.</p>

<p>“All right, Indian,” replied Harvey, drawing
a hunting knife, with which he had armed himself
on leaving the airship camp. “I’ll do the cutting
and I’ll prove to you that you’re in the wrong.
There’s nothing like being fair and right, you
know. Here goes!”</p>

<p>It did not take long to extract the bullet fired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
from the rifle of Standing Horse. It had not penetrated
deeply, and, while in a spot that might have
caused death from bleeding in time, it was not
necessarily vital.</p>

<p>To get Ned’s missile, however, was a harder
task, and Harvey had to cut deeply before he
found it. Then he located it so near the heart
that the organ itself was injured. Ned had aimed
high, but his gun must have dropped as he pulled
the trigger, for the bullet went in back of the right
shoulder, taking a diagonal course and almost
passing through the body of the beast. The
motor boy’s gun was a high-powered one, and the
bullet, mushrooming, or spreading out, had inflicted
a deadly wound.</p>

<p>“There, you see!” exclaimed Harvey,
triumphantly as he laid the two missiles side by
side on the ground. “White boy’s bear!”</p>

<p>For a moment Standing Horse did not reply.
Then he grunted out:</p>

<p>“White man speak with straight tongue.
Indian no say what not so. Indian——”</p>

<p>“I know,” interrupted Harvey, with a laugh.
“You want to say you were mistaken, that’s all.
Go ahead, no hard feelings, only I knew I could
prove it was our bear, and I want my rights, even
if you are on the warpath.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” grunted the redman again, as he
turned to go back to his followers. Evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
they had seen how the dispute had ended. They
were not to get the bear, and they were disappointed
for doubtless, since leaving, they
missed the rations given out at their reservation
which they had deserted. In all probability they
were hungry, and the bear meant a feast to them,
even though the meat was not at its best. Harvey
Brill must have known this, for ere Standing
Horse could join the group of redmen, and secure
his rifle from the Indian who held it, the
Westerner called out:</p>

<p>“Hold on, Standing Horse. Just because I
proved that this was our bear meat doesn’t say
we want it all. There’s more here than we can
use, and, after we take off a few steaks you’re
welcome to the rest. Indians can have most of
the bear.”</p>

<p>“Ya! Ya!” grunted the chief, evidently in
surprised delight. And then, with his customary
disinclination to showing any emotion, the chief
motioned to his followers the further result of
the dispute. The redmen could not restrain a
murmur of delight, which showed their hunger.
Pleased smiles took the place of scowls, and
Ned breathed in relief, for he feared there might
be hostilities.</p>

<p>“I guess this will do us,” remarked Harvey,
as he cut off some of the best portions. “Take
the rest, Standing Horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians needed no second invitation, and
soon were at work cutting up the bear. Others
began making a fire, while Standing Horse, taking
his rifle from the warrior who had held it,
stalked off by himself in gloomy silence.</p>

<p>“Come on, Ned,” suggested the miner, as he
reached our hero, carrying the steaks. “I guess
we’ve done enough hunting for one day. Besides,
I want to get back to the others.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the lad, struck by something
unusual in the tone of the miner.</p>

<p>“Oh—I—er—well, I just want to tell ’em
what happened. They may be anxious about
us.” But Ned knew Harvey Brill had some other
reason.</p>

<p>Jerry, Bob and Jim Nestor were greatly surprised
on the return of the hunters, and more so
when they heard the story. As for Professor
Snodgrass, nothing seemed to worry him. He
went on collecting his bugs, classifying them and
making notes about them, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far away,” advised Mr. Brill
to the little scientist, when the latter was about
to start out again after hearing the story of the
bear.</p>

<p>“Why not?” mildly inquired Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t altogether like the way those
Indians acted,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“But don’t you think they were satisfied with
the way you settled the dispute about the bear?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, fairly so—as much as any hungry
Indians could be satisfied. But those fellows are
looking for trouble. They didn’t leave the
reservation for fun, and they will be up to mischief
sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“Then what had we better do?” asked Jerry.
“I can’t get the rudder in shape for another day
or two. I’ve got to make a whole new part.
We’ll have to stay here, for if we went up we’d
just drift helplessly about. Is there any
danger?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t like to say there was,” answered
Mr. Brill, slowly; “and yet I’m not so
foolish as to say there isn’t. Those bucks are
hungry, and a hungry Indian will do more than
one that has had a good meal. Then, too, they
know we’ve got lots of things aboard here that
they’d like. Of course they may not get up
spunk enough to attack us, and then, again, they
may.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we’d better keep close around
here?” asked Bob, pausing with a pan in his
hand. He had been in the act of getting a meal
when Ned and Harvey Brill returned.</p>

<p>“I think so—yes,” replied the miner. “And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
I think we had better stand on guard, too—night
and day. It won’t do to take chances.
Jim, you and I’ll take turns watching for these
beggars while the boys get the airship in shape to
run. The sooner we leave these diggings the
better I’ll like it. I’ll take first watch,” and,
seeing that his rifle was fully loaded, the Westerner
stalked off a little way in the woods to take
up his position on a slight eminence that gave him
a good view of the surrounding country.</p>

<small>A NIGHT ATTACK</small></h2>


<p>“Well, this is our first bit of bad luck,” remarked
Ned, when the prospector had gone off
to do guard duty. “But I suppose we couldn’t
expect to have everything too easy.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s right,” agreed Jerry. “Well,
now it’s up to us to get busy and make these repairs
as soon as we can. If the Indians want to
make trouble they will, and the best thing for us
to do is to get out of here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it all bad luck,” observed Bob,
as he started back to the galley, whence came appetizing
smells.</p>

<p>“What part isn’t?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Getting the bear steaks was good luck. I’m
going to broil ’em, and we’ll——”</p>

<p>“Well, you are the limit, Chunky!” exclaimed
Jerry. “You can’t see any bad luck in
anything, as long as there are eats connected with
it; eh, Ned?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Well, I am glad that I shot
the bear. He was a big fellow, and if the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
had been in prime condition I think I’d have
tried to make a bargain with the Indians for it.
But it’s too late now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t have any more to do with the beggars
than you have to,” advised Jim Nestor. “Everything
may come out all right yet. Can I help
you boys any?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can,” said Jerry, in a low voice.
“But not by working on the rudder—we can attend
to that. If you keep an eye on Professor
Snodgrass, though, you’ll be doing well. I think
he’ll wander off too far looking for specimens,
in spite of what Harvey said. Just sort of
watch over him; will you? He’ll get so interested
chasing after a one-legged bumble bee
that he won’t realize how far from camp he’s
going.”</p>

<p>“That’s right—I will,” agreed Mr. Nestor,
and he strolled along the path taken by the
scientist, who, intent on capturing a new kind of
butterfly, paid no attention to anything else.</p>

<p>Bob had disappeared into the galley, where
he could be heard whistling and singing by turns
as he prepared the meal.</p>

<p>“Chunky is in his element now,” observed
Jerry, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“He sure is,” came from Ned. “What can
I do, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, you might be making the braces for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the new rudder; I have it nearly finished, but I’m
going to rig the controls a little differently. I
want to make them stronger, so that in case of
a hard blow, straining on them won’t break ’em,
as it did a little while ago. If we work fast we
may be able to leave to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Ned. “I want to
see the color of those sixty nuggets.”</p>

<p>“And the longer we delay,” said Jerry, “the
better chance Noddy Nixon and his crowd have
of getting there ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think they’re after the gold?”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it in the least. I think all they
wanted was to get an idea of the general direction
in which the valley was. Now they’ll
prospect about, join forces with the grub-stakers,
and try to find it. So we don’t want to lose any
time.”</p>

<p>Ned and his tall chum were soon busily engaged
on the rudder. It was no easy task, and
several times Jerry feared it would take at least
two days more to make the repairs.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to spend more than one
night here if I can help it,” he murmured. “Not
with those Indians roaming the woods.”</p>

<p>Bob served the bear steaks, and they all agreed
that they made a tasty meal. Professor Snodgrass
even consented to give up his bug-collecting
long enough to partake of some.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim Nestor relieved Harvey Brill at standing
guard, but, when night fell, it was decided
that instead of staying in the open, and building
a campfire, the watch would be kept from within
the airship.</p>

<p>“We can take turns in the pilot house,” said
Jerry, “and I can mount the search lamp on top
of it, so it can be swung in a circle all about, being
worked from inside. By keeping it on the
move it will flash all around the <i>Comet</i> at intervals,
and the one on watch can spot the Indians
if they try to attack us.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, as far as it goes,” declared
Jim; “but the trouble is that the woods are so
thick, and come so close up to us, that we can’t
see the Indians until the last minute. But it’s
the best we can do.”</p>

<p>“It’s better than nothing,” asserted the other
Westerner. “Maybe I’m over cautious expecting
trouble, but it’s best to be on the safe side.
It’s better to be sure than sorry. Those redmen,
even though I did give ’em most of the
bear, may feel that they have been cheated,
though it was Ned’s bullet that did the killing.
They may persuade the chief to lead the attack.
So we’ll just stand guard all night.”</p>

<p>“We can do some work on the rudder to-night,
too,” decided Jerry, “and that will fix things so
we can surely get off to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, he and Ned labored away after
supper inside the airship, while the professor
classified his day’s catch of bugs, and Jim and
Harvey took turns in the pilot house, the great
searchlight flashing the finger of fire on the dark
trees.</p>

<p>“There, this is all we can do until we can go
outside and attach it, to see how to rig the controls,”
announced Jerry, at ten o’clock. “Now,
how about turning in?”</p>

<p>“You and Ned get some rest,” proposed
Jim. “We can take the early watches, and you
can relieve us after you’ve had some sleep.”</p>

<p>“I want to do my share,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“You shall,” promised the mine foreman.</p>

<p>It fell to Bob’s lot to take the last morning
trick. At three o’clock he took his place in the
pilot house, Jerry and Ned having stood two
hours each. It would be daylight shortly after
five, and then the danger would not be so great.</p>

<p>“If they come at all, it will be just before
dawn,” Jim Nestor had said. “But they may
not come. I haven’t seen a sign of ’em, and I’ve
been watching carefully. That searchlight is a
great stunt. It makes the woods as bright as
day; though, as I said, I wish we had a wider
circle of clearing around us. Keep your eyes
peeled, Bob.”</p>

<p>The stout lad promised, and took his position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
At first he followed the circle of the light zealously,
as it moved about, being operated by a
small motor that sent it revolving on a cogged
base. Then, as he saw nothing but the leafy
shadow of the trees, he became less nervous, and
took his task more comfortably.</p>

<p>Bob was a hearty eater, and, just before coming
on watch he had partaken of a lunch, though
it was night. And, as is well known, a hearty
meal often makes one sleepy. It was so in Bob’s
case.</p>

<p>At first he felt only drowsy. Then he felt his
head nodding from time to time. Once he even
dozed for a moment.</p>

<p>“Come! This won’t do!” he exclaimed. “I
believe I’m getting sleepy. Guess I’ll get a
drink of water.”</p>

<p>As he arose to leave the pilot house, he gave
a look once more all around the little clearing,
lighted by the flashing light. He could see
nothing.</p>

<p>But scarcely had Bob reached the water cooler,
and raised the glass to his lips, then, from the
surrounding forest, arose a chorus of shrill yells—cries
that sent a cold shiver down his spine,
and seemed to stop the beating of his heart.</p>

<p>“Indians!” he yelled. “The Blackfeet!
They’re attacking us! Wake up, everybody!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>INTO THE DEPTHS</small></h2>


<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Where’s my gun?”</p>

<p>“Get ready, everybody!”</p>

<p>“Turn on all the lights!”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the shouts that
greeted Bob’s cry of warning. It was Jerry who
thought to switch on the incandescents, illuminating
the interior of the motorship, which had
hitherto been in darkness. Every member of the
party, save Bob, had fallen into a weary slumber.</p>

<p>The two Westerners, from long habit, had
reached out for their weapons on the instant of
opening their eyes, but the boys were not so
trained. True, Bob had a gun, but he had left
it in the pilot house when he went for a drink of
water.</p>

<p>The yells of the Indians outside increased.
Very likely, since they might have raised their
voices in shouts at some Wild West show, with
which they may have been connected, this was the
first time, in many years, that they had given
vent to the warwhoop; save perhaps in some tribal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ceremonies. But now they were using their lungs
to their full power.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Bob, in desperation.
“We’ve got to fight ’em!” He was not a little
worried lest his slight dereliction from duty
should be held to be responsible for the surprise.
But he need not have alarmed himself, since it
was likely that no one could have seen the redmen
sneak up amid that dense growth of forest.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Jim Nestor, as he sprang out
of his bunk, with ready gun.</p>

<p>The airship seemed to vibrate to several thuds.</p>

<p>“They’re boarding us!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And they’re not firing a shot!” came from
Harvey Brill. “Boys, I see what this means!
They’re trying to scare us, but they haven’t got
nerve enough to use their guns. Maybe this is
only part of the band, that has sneaked off without
the chief knowing it, to get what they can
from us. Come on! We’ll give ’em a warm
reception!”</p>

<p>He leaped to a window, flung it open and began
discharging his weapon, taking care to aim
in the air so as not to hit any of the Indians by
accident. Yells greeted the shot from his rifle,
but Mr. Brill knew what he was doing, and felt
sure he had hit no one.</p>

<p>“That’s the way!” yelled Jim Nestor. “Maybe
we can scare ’em off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>He, too, began firing, an example followed by
Bob and Ned. The yelling increased in intensity,
and the thuds on the deck of the <i>Comet</i> continued,
showing that more of the savages were
climbing over the rail, which offered a slight
obstacle.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of the cabin was pushed
open, and one of the blanketed braves leaped in.
He had no weapon, but, seeing some shining tools
that Ned and Jerry had been using on the rudder
that day, he made a grab for them, evidently
thinking them of great value.</p>

<p>“Hi! Drop those!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“Indian take!” grunted the redman, as he
rushed out again.</p>

<p>“There’s a score of ’em!” cried Harvey Brill,
as he looked out and saw the Indians in the glare
of the searchlight. “Oh, if we could only get
out of this! We don’t want to hurt any of ’em,
for it will mean trouble, and yet we can’t let ’em
strip us! Can we go up, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried the tall lad. “We’ll take a
chance. There’s no wind, and we can manage
without the rudder. We’ll go up as a balloon!
Ned—Bob! Start the gas machine!”</p>

<p>The two lads, dropping their guns, rushed to
the engine room. Jerry hurried to the pilot
house where he saw that all was in readiness for
a quick flight. For, though the <i>Comet</i> could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
ascend as an aeroplane, owing to the broken rudder,
it could still rise as a balloon.</p>

<p>The two Westerners were rapidly firing their
rifles, taking care to aim high, hoping to intimidate
the Indians by the seeming danger.
And, in a measure, they succeeded. Several of
the redmen leaped off the motorship, and disappeared
in the woods. Others, more bold, laid
hands on whatever they could find in the half-darkness
out on deck, and ran off. Still others
penetrated to the interior of the craft. But not
one had a weapon. This the boys thought very
strange until later they learned that Chief Standing
Horse, fearing that some of his followers
might try to take revenge on the whites for the
bear incident, had confiscated the arms of the
younger members of his party, giving them in
charge of the older, and more trusted warriors
of his tribe.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, Ned?” called Jerry to his
chum.</p>

<p>“All right,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then start her going, and we’ll go up!”</p>

<p>It was just beginning to get daylight when
there came a tremor through the whole length
of the <i>Comet</i>. Jerry had cast off the anchor
ropes, and as the powerful gas filled the bag she
tore loose from the earth and shot upward.</p>

<p>There was a cry of surprise and terror from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the Indians still aboard, and the rapid running of
feet across the deck told of a rush to leap off before
the craft went too high.</p>

<p>As it was, several had to drop off from a considerable
distance, and in the dawn of the morning
our friends saw many of the Indians limping
into the forest.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve taught them a lesson,” remarked
Jerry, when the motorship was clear
of the earth, and the last Indian had dropped off.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Ned, who had kept
the gas machine going at full capacity. “They
got a lot of stuff that we may need, but we’re
lucky even so.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t get into the kitchen!” exclaimed
Bob, proudly. “I had a lot of pies there, and if
they’d taken them——”</p>

<p>“Oh, for cats’ sake, Chunky!” cried Jerry.
“Is that all you can think of now?”</p>

<p>“Well, why not?” asked the stout lad.
“We’re all right; aren’t we?”</p>

<p>And they were, when they came to take an
account of themselves. Little damage had been
done to the craft, and only a few articles were
missing. They were now well up in the air, drifting
along before a gentle wind.</p>

<p>“We’ll drift along until we see a good place
to land, and then we’ll go down,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not near here, though,” stipulated Jim
Nestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess not!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Luckily they were able to land in a large clearing,
many miles from where the Indians had attacked
them, and, as they were now over the
Canadian border—a fact ascertained by seeing
some boundary pillars as they crossed—they had
no further fear of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>“But it was a hot time while it lasted,” said
Bob, who explained how the attack had come
about.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served, and then the motor boys
proceeded to finish work on the rudder. Professor
Snodgrass, who had taken no part in the
repulse of the Indians, save to gather his books
and specimen boxes in readiness for instant flight,
resumed his collecting.</p>

<p>The two Westerners devoted themselves to
making a tour of the surrounding country, to look
for possible hostile signs, but found none. Then
they managed to get some small game for Bob
to cook.</p>

<p>The rudder repairs were finished that day, and
a test of the <i>Comet</i> showed it to be under perfect
control.</p>

<p>“Now for the valley of the sixty nuggets of
gold!” cried Jerry, when they were ready to
start off again.</p>

<p>For two days they circled about, looking for
some landmark that would indicate to Mr. Brill
the beginning of the big earth gash where he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
hidden his wealth. They saw, one evening, a
fantastically piled mound of red rock that showed
plainly even from a great height.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried the prospector. “The
valley begins right there!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go down, and camp for to-night,”
decided Jerry, “and in the morning we’ll make
the descent.”</p>

<p>The morning dawned, clear and beautiful.
After an early breakfast they went aloft in the
<i>Comet</i>, which could now be guided better than
ever.</p>

<p>“That’s the valley!” cried Harvey Brill, as
they got above the depths. “Now to see if I can
find my gold after the landslide!”</p>

<p>It was a wild and desolate gash in the earth—a
great valley in the midst of towering mountain
peaks. In very truth nothing but an airship or a
balloon could have entered it as it was now.</p>

<p>“Well, here we go, boys!” said Jerry, a trifle
solemnly, as he tilted the deflecting rudder.</p>

<p>All about them were rugged peaks, some snow-capped,
others, not so high, covered with a dense
forest growth. Below them lay the mysterious
and silent valley that hid the wealth of gold.</p>

<p>Would they find it?</p>

<p>Everyone asked himself that question as the
<i>Comet</i> descended into the depths.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>A DISAPPOINTED PROFESSOR</small></h2>


<p>Wild and desolate indeed, was the scene upon
which those in the motorship gazed as their craft
sank into the valley on the Canadian Border.
Located in the midst of a vast mountain range,
the great gash in the earth looked as if a giant
had, with some titanic shovel, scooped out earth
and rocks to make a vast bed for himself.
The valley, located well up in the midst of the
mountains, extended north and south for many
miles. In fact it lay directly across the Border,
so that about half of it was in Canada and the
other half in the United States.</p>

<p>The boys and their companions had noticed
some of the boundary marks just before they began
their descent, and they could easily determine
their position.</p>

<p>“Think you can make a landing, Jerry?”
asked Jim Nestor, as he stood beside the tall lad
in the pilot house. “It’s pretty rough down
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can land all right,” asserted Jerry. “I
can manipulate the <i>Comet</i> to make her go almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
anywhere, and we don’t need a very large smooth
place to anchor her. But it sure is all mixed up.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Looks as if some one stood up on the tops
of the mountains and threw big rocks down
here,” commented Bob, who had come from the
kitchen, where supper was in course of preparation.</p>

<p>And indeed Bob’s description was as accurate
as any. The floor of the long, but narrow, valley
was covered with great rocks and boulders,
some of them of vari-colored sandstone, and
others of hard, and almost black, granite. Some
were of odd shapes, and they differed in size
from those almost as large as a house, to mere
rocks that a lad could have tossed.</p>

<p>“That happened when the landslide came
down,” explained Mr. Brill. “If you’d been
here then you would have thought the earth was
coming to an end. I never heard such a racket,
and the way the rocks and earth tumbled down
here was a caution. I just got out in time. If I
hadn’t I might be here yet—but not alive.”</p>

<p>From what little view the gold-seekers had of
the valley in the gathering darkness it did seem
almost impossible of ascent or descent by ordinary
means. It was not that the sides were so steep—though
they were anything but of gentle slope—but
the rugged walls, with here and there sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
precipices, made them out of the question to scale.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a balloon could get down here,”
said Mr. Brill. “A balloon or an airship. It
was a good thing you thought of these boys, Jim,
or we’d never have had a chance for the gold.
I don’t believe anyone else could get into this valley;
or, if they could, they couldn’t get out again.”</p>

<p>This was not exactly so, as they learned later.
For when they had been in the valley some time,
and were prepared to leave, they discovered, away
up on the Canadian side, a comparatively easy
descent. But it was so hidden, and in such an out-of-the-way
place that only by the merest accident
was it located.</p>

<p>“We can’t do much gold seeking to-night,”
said Jerry, as he guided the aircraft to a comparatively
level spot where he intended to anchor
her. “It’s getting darker every minute, and it
doesn’t look very inviting to go traveling around
among those rocks, not knowing what moment
they may come rolling down on you.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the man who had hidden
the gold. “We’ll wait until morning. Anyhow,
I don’t believe I’d be able to pick out the
landmarks by which I’ll have to be guided to the
<i>cache</i>. I’ll need daylight for that. You see, after
I found out that I was being spied upon, I
made several bluffs at hiding the gold. That is,
I pretended to put it in two or three different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
places. But it’s all hidden in one spot, and I’ll
locate that to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll dig up the gold, and spend a few
days hunting before we go back East,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe it won’t be as easy finding it as you
think,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I can walk right to it, when we
get near enough,” asserted the miner; “but it’s
several miles from here—more in the center of
the valley.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one comfort,” said Jim Nestor.
“We won’t be troubled by the Blackfeet to-night.”</p>

<p>“No, but we may be troubled by <em>cold</em> feet!”
exclaimed Ned, with a chuckle. “It’s getting
chilly. I guess we’ll have to start the furnace
to-night, Jerry.”</p>

<p>It was quite cold up among the mountains, even
though they were almost at the bottom of a deep
valley, and the tall young pilot closed the windows
of the airship.</p>

<p>“We can start the electric heaters,” he said,
for the <i>Comet</i> was equipped with all the latest
improvements in the way of comforts. “Bob,
turn ’em on when you go back to finish supper.”</p>

<p>“That’s so! I forgot about that cake!” cried
the stout lad, as he made a dash for the galley.
“I left it in the oven, and it smells as if it was
burning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cake! He’s the limit!” cried Ned. “He’d
make some kind of pastry, or dessert, if he had
to use crackers and water, and we were eating
our last meal. I never saw such a chap for
grub!”</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” suggested Jerry, good-naturedly.
“He means all right.”</p>

<p>“That looks like a good place to land,” suggested
Jim Nestor, a little later, as the airship
approached a spot comparatively free from
boulders.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it,” agreed Jerry, and a few minutes
afterward the motorship was safely anchored,
while night settled down over the mysterious valley.</p>

<p>Bob’s fear for the cake proved unfounded, and
the dainty came to the supper table, shortly afterward,
in perfect condition. With the airship
closed up, and the electric heaters going, the
gold-seekers were very comfortable.</p>

<p>They sat about after the meal, talking over
what lay before them. It seemed that they were
almost at the end of their quest, though they
realized that danger and uncertainty might beset
them. Professor Snodgrass had about finished
making notes of the specimens thus far captured.
Placing away his books and boxes, he put on his
hat, stretched himself, and started for the door of
the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“To look for those luminous snakes,” was the
answer. “It is good and dark now, and I can
see them well. Now that we are in the valley
where they exist I must lose no time in securing
some specimens.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d wait until morning,” requested
the tall lad. “We don’t know anything of this
valley, and, if you go prospecting around it in
the dark, something may happen. Besides, there
may be wild beasts here.”</p>

<p>“All the better!” exclaimed the professor.
“I can get more specimens!”</p>

<p>Jerry was unable to persuade Uriah Snodgrass
to stay in, but, as a compromise, the
scientist consented to take Harvey Brill and Ned
with him, while the others made everything snug
for the night.</p>

<p>But Mr. Snodgrass was doomed to disappointment,
for though he and the others searched all
around, within a radius of half a mile of the aircraft,
no luminous snakes were discovered.</p>

<p>“Do you think they can all have vanished?”
asked Mr. Snodgrass of the miner.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, for there were lots of them that I
saw. But I can’t just say it was here that I
noticed them. It may have been farther up or
down the valley. Besides, I wasn’t paying much
attention to such critters. I wanted to fool the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
grub-stakers who were on my trail, and hide my
gold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what was gold compared to the luminous
snakes?” demanded the scientist. “If I had had
your chance I would never have let it slip. Think
of being able to present a luminous snake to a
museum!”</p>

<p>“I’d rather get my sixty nuggets,” murmured
the miner as, with the disappointed professor,
he returned to the aircraft.</p>

<small>WATCHED</small></h2>


<p>“Hey, fellows, get up! I’ve got hot coffee
ready for you, and we’ll start right out!”</p>

<p>“For cats’ sake, who’s that?” demanded the
sleepy voice of Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t ask,” murmured Jerry.
“It’s Bob, of course, though how he managed to
get up so early is one of the mysteries.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Bob, as he banged on the
doors of the sleeping rooms of his chums.
“We’re going to get that gold to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s the game,” said Jerry. “Bob
is hot on the treasure hunt! Well, I suppose we
had better get started.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned, as he leaped out
from amid the bedclothes.</p>

<p>It was the morning after their first night spent
in the gold valley, and the sun had arisen without
anything of moment having occurred during
the darkness. They had not felt the necessity of
maintaining a watch, and, as it proved, there was
no need of one. In the desolate valley they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
not disturbed. There was scarcely any wind to
sway the anchored airship.</p>

<p>Bob was as good as his promise. He not only
had hot coffee ready, but bacon and eggs, toasted
crackers—for bread was difficult to bake and
hard to keep fresh—and other things that invited
hungry appetites.</p>

<p>“Well, now what’s the programme?” asked
Ned, when the meal was over.</p>

<p>“I’m going to look for the luminous snakes!”
exclaimed Professor Snodgrass, as he hurriedly
jumped up to capture a new kind of fly that had
buzzed in through the open window. “The rest
of you can look for the gold if you like.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess there’s no reason for any more
disguise work,” spoke Jerry. “We’ve left the
Blackfeet Indians behind, the grub-stakers don’t
appear to have followed us, and we seem to have
left Noddy Nixon and his crew in the lurch.
So, if the professor wants to go off by himself for
specimens, I guess he can, while we try to locate
where the gold is hidden.”</p>

<p>That seemed to satisfy them all, and they
turned to Harvey Brill, on whom would fall the
burden of locating the hidden nuggets of gold.</p>

<p>“If we can get in the airship, and move along
slowly, not too high up, I think I can pick out the
landmark that will tell me where I made the
<i>cache</i>,” said the miner. “It’s near a big rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that looks like a church, as much as anything—it
has a regular steeple.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see why we can’t do that,” returned
Jerry. “I can run the airship along as
near to the ground as we like, by putting just a
small charge of gas in the bag, so she won’t rise
too high. It will be easier than walking the
length of this valley, with all the rocks around.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t see the snakes, unless I’m right
on the ground,” objected the professor.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that,” went on the tall lad.
“You can walk, if you like. We can leave you
some food and water, and you can prospect as
much as you please, just where you like. When
you want us to come back and pick you up, just
raise this flag as a signal, on a pole,” and Jerry
produced a red cloth that could be picked out at
some distance. “Then we’ll run the airship
back and get you,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“And the snakes, too!” exclaimed the professor.
“Don’t forget them. I’m bound to secure
those specimens!”</p>

<p>“I hope you do,” murmured Ned; “and I
hope we get the gold.”</p>

<p>“We’ll just have to!” exclaimed Bob. “If
not the sixty nuggets, then some other, for the
folks back home are sort of banking on us, and
we can’t disappoint ’em after they’ve invested
their money in the chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Harvey Brill.
“Oh, I’m going to make good, or I’ll go off
grub-staking again and discover another pocket
of gold. I won’t see your folks done out of their
money!” He seemed to feel his responsibility.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass began getting his apparatus
ready for catching alive the luminous snakes,
and it was arranged to take him a little way up
the valley in the motorship, leave him, and then
proceed on the gold hunt.</p>

<p>The gas machine was set going, and with only
enough of the powerful vapor in the big bag to
lift the craft above the highest of the big rocks
that were strewn over the valley, they set off.
Professor Snodgrass alighted about two miles
from their first camping place, and at once began
an eager search for new specimens. Then the
others went slowly on.</p>

<p>“A rock that looks like a church; eh?” mused
Ned, who had replaced Jerry at the steering
wheels. “Well, there are all sorts and shapes
of rocks here, you can take your choice.”</p>

<p>“I picked out that one,” explained the miner,
“as I thought it was so big that nothing would
ever move it. I hid the gold in a sort of stone
pocket at the foot of it.”</p>

<p>Eagerly they peered about for a sight of the
great stone that would mark the hiding place of
the nuggets. Mr. Brill had a general idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
where he had <i>cached</i> his fortune, and said they
would not reach it much before passing the center
of the valley.</p>

<p>“But we’d better take no chances,” he added;
“for the landslide may have shifted things so
that I’d pass over the spot before I knew it. So
go slow, and we’ll look all along the way.”</p>

<p>Several times he thought he saw, in the distance,
the big “church-rock” of which they were
in search, and the airship would be sent to it,
only to disappoint the searchers. For, when they
got nearer the boulder, its form would change.</p>

<p>“That isn’t it,” Harvey Brill would say, and
they would start off again.</p>

<p>This was kept up for some time, but shortly
after dinner, when they were skimming along
just above the surface, the old miner uttered a
cry:</p>

<p>“There it is! I’m sure of it!” he exclaimed.
“I’m not fooled this time! There’s the rock
landmark!”</p>

<p>Indeed, about a mile off was a great pile of
stones that bore a strong resemblance to a
church. There was even a slender steeple.</p>

<p>“That looks like it,” admitted Jerry, who had
again gone to the steering tower. “We’ll drop
down there and have a look.”</p>

<p>A nearer view only served to confirm Mr.
Brill in his belief, and, as they alighted from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
airship, he fairly ran to the foot of the great
rock, and began looking about.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure this is the place,” he said,
but the boys noticed that his voice was not as confident
as it had been. “We’ll just dig a bit
around here,” he went on. “It may be that the
rains have washed dirt over the <i>cache</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the digging,” volunteered Jim Nestor,
who had a pick and shovel, and soon he was making
the rocks and dirt scatter, while the others
looked on eagerly. Mr. Brill seemed a bit
puzzled, however, and from time to time gazed
off across the valley, as if to make sure this, and
none other, was the rock he sought.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who was thinking of returning
to the airship for a sandwich, uttered a cry, and
pointed to a cliff that towered above their heads—one
of the upper boundaries of the valley.</p>

<p>“Look!” he exclaimed. “We’re being spied
upon!”</p>

<p>They all glanced to where he pointed, and
there, boldly outlined against the sky, they saw a
number of figures looking down on them—watching
them.</p>

<p>“Blackfeet!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“They’re not Indians!” asserted Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“Then it’s Noddy Nixon and his crowd!” declared
Jerry. “They have managed to trail
us!”</p>

<small>THE LUMINOUS SNAKES</small></h2>


<p>“Get the guns!”</p>

<p>It was Harvey Brill who exclaimed this, as he
darted for the motorship. But Jim Nestor laid
a restraining hand on his partner’s arm.</p>

<p>“Now, hold on,” suggested the mine foreman,
in easy tones. “This is no time for shooting
irons. I’m opposed to ’em on general principles,
anyhow. There’s very few times when you need
’em. We can attend to those fellows all right
without getting down to desperate measures.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not going to have ’em take that gold
from me!” exclaimed the miner, fiercely.</p>

<p>“No danger,” said Jim, easily. “They’re
quite a way off, and they’re going to have their
own troubles getting down to us. Besides, we
haven’t found the gold ourselves yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe that’s so,” admitted the miner,
calming down somewhat. “What had we better
do?”</p>

<p>“Try and discover exactly what they’re doing,”
decided Jerry, promptly. “Ned, get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
glasses from the pilot house, and we’ll take a
look at ’em!”</p>

<p>In a few moments the tall lad was peering
sharply at the party high up on the cliffs. So
far away were they that they looked like small
children, and only the fact that they did not present
the characteristics of Indians led to the assumption
that they were Noddy Nixon’s companions
and himself.</p>

<p>“It’s them, all right!” announced Jerry, after
a moment. “And they’re looking at us with
spy glasses. I guess they think they can see us
when we find the gold.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as they don’t come down I
won’t worry so much,” spoke Mr. Brill. “But
as for finding the gold here we’re not going to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jerry and Ned together,
in alarm. Bob had gone to the airship galley to
see about the meal.</p>

<p>“Because, after all, this isn’t the place,” said
the miner. “I’ve made a mistake. It was coming
down the valley the other way that I spotted
the rock that looks like a church, and there I hid
the gold. Coming toward this rock from the opposite
direction did make it look like the same
one. But now, when I get a different view of it,
I see that it isn’t the place. We’ll have to hunt
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to go up to the other end of
the valley, and start from there,” decided Jerry.
“We can get the right view of the rock
then.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only way, I guess,” agreed the miner.</p>

<p>“And there’s no more use digging here,” came
from Jim Nestor, as he took up the pick and
shovel and started toward the airship. “It’ll
fool those fellows,” and he chuckled as he waved
his hand toward the group on the cliff above
them.</p>

<p>“They seem some put out,” observed Ned,
who was looking at Noddy and his cronies
through the glasses. “They’re holding a conference,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“What about the professor?” asked Mr.
Brill, as they all left the big rock. “If we’re
going to the other end of the valley do we want
to leave him near here?”</p>

<p>“No, we’d better pick him up,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Let’s have dinner first,” suggested Bob.
“I’ve got it almost ready.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Chunky; don’t let anything interfere
with the meals,” laughed Jerry.</p>

<p>Another look at the place on the cliff where
the spies had been, showed that they had
vanished. Probably they had observed that they
were being looked at with glasses, and did not
want to betray their movements too much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder what they’re up to?” said Ned.</p>

<p>“After the gold, of course,” came from Mr.
Brill. “But they’ll have a fight before they get
it. I think I saw some of the grub-stakers in
the bunch,” he added, for he had gazed long and
earnestly at those on the cliff.</p>

<p>“And maybe we’ll have trouble before we get
the nuggets,” put in Jim Nestor. “If you can be
mistaken once on your landmarks, Harvey, you
may be again. And this valley seems to be full
of queer-shaped rocks.”</p>

<p>“It is,” assented the miner; “but once we
start down it from the other direction I know I
can pick out the place where I buried the nuggets.
I’ll get ’em!”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Ned, for he knew his
father had placed much confidence in the efforts
of himself and his chums.</p>

<p>“Now to pick up the professor,” announced
Jerry, when the meal was over, and the airship
ready to proceed. A look at the cliff showed no
signs of the spies, though all realized that they
might be down behind rocks, peering at the gold-seekers,
and so hidden as to be out of sight even
of the powerful glasses.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> sailed back down the valley, keeping
but a short distance above the tallest peaks,
or groups of boulders.</p>

<p>“Look for the red flag,” counseled Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
“I told the professor to hoist it on a pole to
guide us to him.”</p>

<p>“And he’s just as likely to take it and make
some sort of snake trap of it, as he is to hoist
it,” said Ned. “In fact I doubt if even he
remembers to put it up, he’ll be so much taken
up with looking for the snakes.”</p>

<p>As they neared the place where they had left
the scientist they all looked down for a sight of
him, but they saw no red flag, nor did they
glimpse the little figure of the collector.</p>

<p>“He must be back of some rocks,” said Bob.
They were drifting along now, before a gentle
wind, and the motor was shut off. Moving as a
balloon, and guided only by the breeze they made
not a round.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by a cry.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” shouted a voice. “Help!
I’ve got the snakes, but I’m caught and they may
get away! Help!”</p>

<p>“The professor!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“And a snake has him!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” declared Harvey Brill. “The
luminous snakes are only little things. They
couldn’t hurt a cat.”</p>

<p>But again came the cry:</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Help me save the luminous
snakes!”</p>

<p>“He must have ’em!” declared Jim Nestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The airship drifted around a pile of rocks,
and there, <a href="#image03">lying at full length on the ground</a>, his
foot caught under a big stone, <a href="#image03">was Professor
Snodgrass</a>. In either hand he held a wriggling
serpent.</p>

<small>THE HIDDEN MAN</small></h2>


<p>“Someone has attacked him!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was Noddy Nixon and his crowd,”
added Bob. “Quick, Jerry! Let’s help him.”</p>

<p>“I’m getting there as fast as I can,” replied
the tall lad. “But I don’t believe any one has
attacked him. He’s all alone.”</p>

<p>“He’s hurt, anyhow,” declared Jim Nestor.</p>

<p>“His foot is caught,” added Mr. Brill. “I
guess he must have stepped on a loose rock, and
it rolled over on him, pinning him fast. I hope
his leg isn’t broken.”</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” cried the professor again.
“Get the snakes for me! They’re wriggling
loose! I can’t hold ’em much longer!”</p>

<p>“They are slippery customers, I guess,” asserted
Jim, grimly.</p>

<p>A moment later Jerry brought the airship to
a stop, not far from where the scientist was held
a prisoner by the stone. All together they leaped
out and ran to his relief.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned started to roll away the stone,
while Bob, Jim and Harvey began to lift the professor’s
head and shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t!” he begged them. “Let me alone.
I’m all right. Just take these two luminous
snakes from me, and put ’em in a box. There’s
another one, and maybe more in a hole back
there. I must get them. But don’t mind me. I
can wait. Save the snakes!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the limit!” exclaimed Jim Nestor,
as he turned his attention to the wriggling serpents,
which the professor still held—one in each
hand. As Mr. Brill had said they were small,
and not to be feared unless their bite was poisonous,
and this did not seem to be so.</p>

<p>“Put ’em in boxes!” called the professor.
“You’ll find some over there,” and he nodded
his head toward the left. Jerry saw some of the
glass-topped specimen cases which the scientist
used, and ran for them.</p>

<p>“Get the snakes, boys!” the tall lad called to
Ned and Bob, and, as they had often helped the
professor gather other queer prizes, they were
not at all squeamish about handling the serpents.
Ned got one, and Bob the other, holding them
until Jerry came up with the boxes, into which
they were thrust, and the covers fastened down.</p>

<p>“Are they safe?” asked Mr. Snodgrass, from
his position on the ground, where he was still
held by the stone.</p>

<p>“All safe,” replied Jerry, with a smile.
“Now will you let us attend to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will now—yes,” answered the scientist.
“But I’m not hurt. I’m just held fast by the
rock. Its weight rests on some other stones, and
doesn’t press much on my foot. If you can pry it
off I can get up, I think.”</p>

<p>The rock was a large one, and, as Mr. Snodgrass
said, was kept from all but a slight contact
with his leg by a sort of arch of other loose
stones.</p>

<p>“Here’s a big tree branch we can use for a
lever,” said Mr. Brill, as he brought the limb
up, and stuck one end of it beneath the stone.
While he and Jim Nestor pried on it, raising the
big boulder, Jerry and his chums assisted the professor
to crawl out, and in a few seconds he was
free. He could stand up, but when he tried to
walk he limped.</p>

<p>“You’ll need some liniment,” was Jerry’s
opinion.</p>

<p>“Never mind about me!” exclaimed the collector.
“Where are those snakes? We must
get the others, too. I saw a lot of ’em here, but
most of ’em got away. It was when I made a
jump for the two that I slipped, and sent a lot
of rocks rolling down the side hill. Then I was
caught and pinned fast. But I had hold of the
snakes, and I knew you would come along, sometime,
and rescue me.”</p>

<p>“You have had a narrow escape,” said Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
as he handed his friend the two boxes containing
the serpents.</p>

<p>“That’s what he did!” exclaimed Harvey
Brill. “That nearly happened to me in the landslide
after I had hid the gold. But are you sure
you’re all right, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Of course! Oh, you little beauties!”
exclaimed the scientist, as he gazed at the
wriggling snakes. “How glad I am that I found
you! You’ll be worth hundreds of dollars to
the museum, and all the other collectors will envy
me. I think I’ll write a book about these snakes,”
he went on. “I must stay here a long time, and
make a study of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will, you will, I suppose,”
laughed Jerry. “But we’ve got to find the
gold.”</p>

<p>“Did you get any trace of it?” asked the
scientist.</p>

<p>“No, I’m sort of off my bearings,” replied
Mr. Brill. “But I’ll soon pick up the trail again.
We’re going to start at the other end of the valley.”</p>

<p>“But we might as well wait until to-morrow,
for that,” suggested Jerry. “It is late afternoon
now, and will be dark soon. Then, too, we can
stay here with the professor, and let him study
the habits of the snakes. To-morrow will do to
start off for the gold again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>They agreed with him, and the professor, after
putting his two latest specimens safely in the
airship, began making notes about them, ignoring
his slight lameness.</p>

<p>“We must get some more specimens,” he declared.
“They are around here.”</p>

<p>“But they don’t seem to be luminous snakes,”
objected Bob. “They don’t give off any light,
and they look just like some of the snakes back
in the East, except that they’re of a different
color.”</p>

<p>“They don’t give off any light until night,”
explained Mr. Snodgrass; “but I’m sure they are
the right kind. Will you help me to get some
more?”</p>

<p>Everyone was eager to oblige the scientist,
and, after the airship was anchored, they began
to search among the rocks for the luminous
snakes. They were not easy to locate, however,
and several times the boys, in their enthusiasm,
made grabs for snakes which the professor
laughingly declared were worthless, as far as
saving them for museum specimens was concerned.</p>

<p>“You must look at the markings before you
pick up the snakes,” he told the lads, and then he
described how to detect the luminous snakes from
the other specimens. Harvey Brill could tell the
queer serpents at a glance, and he was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to capture one of those that had eluded the professor.</p>

<p>So eager did all become in their strange quest,
searching in and out among the rocks, that they
did not notice a figure slip over the edge of the
precipice that hemmed in the valley, and
dangling from the end of a lariat held by a number
of men on top of the cliff, slide down to a
fairly good foothold. Nor did they notice this
same figure creeping and crawling along amid the
rocks, keeping out of sight as much as was possible.</p>

<p>Had they observed this figure—a man—they
might have recognized him as the same one who
had so suddenly changed his destination in the
railroad station that day—the man with the
scar. But they did not see him, so eager were
they to get more snakes for the professor.</p>

<p>And the man who had made the bold and successful
attempt to enter the valley, at one of the
very few places where such an attempt was
feasible, crept on, murmuring to himself:</p>

<p>“At last I’ve got ’em just where I want ’em!
They’re in our power now, and as soon as they
dig out that gold I’ll signal to the others and
we’ll surround ’em. It’s going to be hard work
getting down here, though, and I doubt if we
can all make it. That Nixon fellow is too big a
coward, and so is that Bill Berry, though if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hadn’t been for them I wouldn’t have gotten on
the trail so easily. But here they are, and as
soon as they have the gold which that fellow hid,
well——”</p>

<p>The man did not finish, but, creeping on, was
soon so near our party of friends that he could
hear their talk. He had managed to keep himself
hidden, though probably if Jerry and the
others had not been so intent on looking for the
snakes they might have seen him.</p>

<p>“We must hurry,” remarked Jerry, after they
had found two or three more snakes lurking in
crevices of the rocks. “It will soon be dark.”</p>

<p>“I think we have nearly all of them,” spoke
Harvey Brill. “There aren’t many more hidden
away.”</p>

<p>“Those are the nuggets he hid,” whispered
the sneaking man to himself. “I’m glad I
waited until they dug them out for us.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another!” suddenly exclaimed Bob,
making a dive down in the stones. He was close
to the hidden grub-staker, though the stout lad
did not know it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall be a rich man!” exclaimed the
delighted professor. “Every one is a prize!”</p>

<p>“And we’ll be rich when we get ’em away from
you,” murmured the hidden man. “Things will
soon be coming our way.”</p>

<p>He raised himself up, and took a cautious observation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
He saw the boys and men grouped
about a small cavern in the rocks—a cavern
where most of the luminous snakes had been
found. At that moment Jerry made a grab, crying:</p>

<p>“Here’s another!”</p>

<p>“And about the last one,” added the professor.
“I think those are all I counted. We
have enough, anyhow,” and he took the
wriggling snake which Jerry held out to him.</p>

<p>The hidden man saw it. A great change came
over his face. It grew red with anger, and then
white from disappointment.</p>

<p>“Snakes!” he hoarsely whispered. “Snakes!
Great Peter! They’re after snakes and not
gold! I’ve been stung! They are with that
scientist after all! Snakes! Not gold! Oh,
what chumps we are!” and he sank back out of
sight as the party turned to go to the airship.</p>

<small>THE EMPTY POCKET</small></h2>


<p>“Well, part of our quest is finished, anyhow,”
remarked Ned to Jerry, as they entered
the <i>Comet</i>. “We’ve got the snakes. Maybe
we’ll get the gold.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll get it,” exclaimed Harvey
Brill, with decision. “Do you think I’m going
to let your folks lose their money? I guess not!
I’ll get the gold I hid, or I’ll find some more. I
want to complete the deal on that mine, and I
can’t do it unless I get those sixty nuggets. Oh,
I’ll find ’em all right, as soon as we start to come
up the valley from the other end, so I can pick
out my landmark.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Jerry, for he, as did
the others, wanted “to make good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we got the snakes, and maybe we’ll get
the gold,” said Bob, as he went to the kitchen to
see about preparing the evening meal. “But I
don’t believe those serpents are luminous.” He
had glanced at them on his way from the main
cabin, where Professor Snodgrass was enthusiastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
making notes about his latest prizes.
“If they don’t shine to-night,” went on Bob,
“Mr. Snodgrass will surely be disappointed.
But I hope he isn’t.”</p>

<p>Could the hidden man have heard what our
friends said, about not having found the gold,
he might not have felt so chagrined as he got
ready to rejoin his companions on the cliffs. But
he had only overheard the talk about snakes, and
had seen the boys and the men hunting for the
serpents. He had not heard gold mentioned.</p>

<p>“This sure is the limit!” he muttered, as he
crawled away from his hiding place, now that the
coast was clear, the party being in the airship.</p>

<p>“Here I go and follow these fellows on a hard
trail, thinking they’re after gold, and it turns out
to be snakes! I get ’em to lower me over the
cliff, and ’most break my neck, all for the pleasure
of seein’ ’em catch snakes. Bah! I’m a fine
one, I am, and it’s all that Nixon fellow’s fault!
I’ll settle with him! He said they were after
gold, and it’s snakes! Wow! Snakes! I’ll be
the laughing stock of all the grub-stakers along
the Border. There’s been a slip-up somewhere,
and I can’t tell where it is. Yet I was sure that
one of those fellows was the one who was said to
have hidden the gold. But it was snakes! Bah!
Snakes! This is the limit!”</p>

<p>He made his way through the gathering darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to where his party anxiously awaited him.
It was hard work hauling him up by means of the
lariat, and once he slipped, severely hurting his
back.</p>

<p>“Did you get a trace of it?” eagerly demanded
Noddy Nixon, who was one of the
throng on the cliff.</p>

<p>“Was all the gold hidden where we saw ’em
digging?” asked Bill Berry.</p>

<p>“Say! Don’t talk to me!” sullenly replied
the man, as he limped along. “This has been a
fizzle, and it’s all your fault!” he added, turning
to Noddy. “Don’t talk to me! And don’t
you dare say snakes or gold!”</p>

<p>By degrees, however, the disappointed party
got the truth from him, and many were the expressions
of anger against Noddy. And yet he
was not so much to blame. Though he had
managed to spy and eavesdrop enough to learn
that Jerry and the others were after gold, and
though he had managed to trace the course of the
airship sufficiently to pick out the location of the
valley after a long trip on a lonely trail, still
some of the others had before this tried to rob
Harvey Brill, and they had been as eager as was
Noddy to take up the mean work again.</p>

<p>“Huh! Snakes!” exclaimed Jake Paxton, the
man who had gone down in the gulch, as he and
the others moved away from the top of the cliff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in the darkness. “Now we’ve got it all to do
over again, for I’m sure someone has hidden gold
in that valley, and I’m going to get it. We’ll just
stay here a spell yet.”</p>

<p>In the airship there was rejoicing mingled with
uncertainty. The professor was glad because he
had found the snakes, but the others were a bit
uncertain in regarding to finding the sixty
nuggets, though Harvey Brill was positive that
his quest would be successful.</p>

<p>“Of course the landslide mixed things up,” he
explained; “and it isn’t going to be as easy to
find the place as I thought. But I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>“Supper!” announced Bob, at this juncture,
and for once no one joked about his fondness for
always having something to do with eating.
They were all hungry.</p>

<p>“Where’s the professor?” asked Jerry, as
they filed out into the dining cabin. “He must
be——”</p>

<p>“Boys! Boys!” suddenly called the scientist.
“Come here—quick!”</p>

<p>“Trouble again!” cried Ned, as he made a
rush for the professor’s cabin, whence came his
voice.</p>

<p>“Those snakes!” murmured Jerry. “Maybe,
after all, they are poisonous!”</p>

<p>“Quick! Quick!” yelled the professor, and,
as they reached him, breathless, Jerry asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it; are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Hurt? No!” exclaimed the little scientist,
and there was triumph in his tones. “Look!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a small box on his table, and
from it came a subdued glow, as though a whole
box of the old-fashioned sulphur matches had
been dampened.</p>

<p>“The luminous snakes!” exclaimed Professor
Snodgrass. “See them shine with light! They
are the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illustris serpensus</i>! I am a most
fortunate man! My name will be engraven on
the roll of fame! For years I have sought these
snakes, and now I have some! Oh, my college
will be proud of me!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Ned. “They do
shine!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it. The professor had
only one light dimly going in his cabin, and now
he switched this off. The glow from the box of
snakes increased, until it made the room light
enough to distinguish faces.</p>

<p>“What makes it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The same sort of matter that causes the
lightning bugs to glow,” explained the professor.
“Under the skin of the snake is a certain material,
mixed in with the color pigments, and that
becomes excited by the nerve cells acting on the
circulatory system. In fact——”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, they shine!” interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Ned, with a laugh, for sometimes the professor
got on one of his long scientific explanations, and
hardly knew when to stop, he grew so enthusiastic
about it.</p>

<p>“Yes, they shine!” exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.
“My search has been successful.”</p>

<p>“And I hope ours will be,” remarked Jerry, as
they went to rather a late supper.</p>

<p>They made an early start the next morning,
heading the airship for the farther end of the valley,
intending, on reaching it, to turn and come
back, so that Mr. Brill could pick out the stone
that resembled a church—the stone that served
as a landmark for the hiding place of the gold.
The going trip was quickly made, but, though
they kept a lookout for the stone, no one saw it.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we could pick it out going this
way,” explained the prospector. “But it will
show soon enough when we head back the other
way, and get near it.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Brill was fairly sure that he had hidden
the gold some distance from the lower end
of the valley, little time was spent there, once
they had begun the return trip.</p>

<p>It was about noon, and Bob was just thinking
of getting dinner, when Mr. Brill, who was
in the pilot house with Jerry, remarked:</p>

<p>“Go slow, now. I think it’s somewhere
around here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Comet’s</i> speed was reduced, and a little
later, as they swung over a pile of fantastically
heaped-up rocks, the prospector cried:</p>

<p>“There it is! There is the stone near where
I hid the gold! Let’s get out and hunt for it!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a mass of rock that did bear a
close resemblance to a church, steeple and all. It
was a much more realistic resemblance than the
other had been.</p>

<p>“That’s her all right!” asserted Mr. Brill.
“Things have changed considerable though, since
I hid the gold, but I guess that’s on account of the
landslide. But there’s the pocket all right, where
I put the nuggets,” and, as they had all gotten out
of the airship, he pointed to a crevice near the
great stone—a fissure in the side of the valley
partly filled with rocks.</p>

<p>“The gold is there!” cried Harvey Brill,
pointing with a shaking hand. “I took it out of
the sacks, and put it in there in a wooden box.”</p>

<p>Jim Nestor had brought a pick, and he now attacked
the loose stones with vigor. A few minutes
sufficed to clear out the fissure, or pocket,
where Mr. Brill had deposited the nuggets.</p>

<p>“Why—why—it’s empty!” gasped the mine
foreman, as he got to the bottom. “There isn’t
any gold here, Harvey! And no box, either!”</p>

<p>“No gold there!” cried the prospector,
aghast.</p>

<p>“Not a nugget! The pocket is empty!”</p>

<small>A PERILOUS SEARCH</small></h2>


<p>Surprise and disappointment held them all
silent for a few moments after Jim Nestor had
made the momentous discovery. Jerry was the
first to speak, and he asked:</p>

<p>“Are you sure this is the place, Mr. Brill?
Might you not be mistaken? There are so many
big rocks, and from here I see another that looks
something like a church.”</p>

<p>“No, this is the rock all right,” declared the
prospector. “Look, here is where I left one of
the sacks that I carried the nuggets in,” and from
under a small pile of rocks that held it down he
picked up a canvas bag.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Jim Nestor,
scratching his head in perplexity. “But where is
the gold?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve got to find out!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“Are you sure this is the sack you left?” asked
Bob of the prospector. “Maybe some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
grub-stakers dropped this here when they were
searching for the gold.”</p>

<p>For answer Mr. Brill held out the sack, and silently
pointed to the initials “H. B.” marked on
it in ink.</p>

<p>“I put ’em there,” he said. “I’d know ’em
anywhere. It was one of the three sacks I had
the sixty nuggets in. I took the others away with
me, but as they bulged out my pockets so, I left
this one here, after I put the nuggets in a box.
Oh, there’s no doubt that this is the place where
I hid the gold.”</p>

<p>“But what has become of it?” asked Professor
Snodgrass, who, now that he had found
his snakes, consented to take an interest in other
matters.</p>

<p>“Those fellows got it!” declared Jim Nestor.
“They got ahead of us after all, and they’ve
taken it!”</p>

<p>“It looks so,” agreed Ned. “What had we
better do?”</p>

<p>“Take after ’em right away!” declared Harvey
Brill.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed Bob. “We’ll have
dinner, and start the chase.”</p>

<p>“Yes, be sure and have dinner first,” remarked
Jerry, half sarcastically. He was bitterly disappointed
over the failure of their expedition. So
were the others, as their faces showed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“We ought to be able to catch up to ’em in the
airship,” was Mr. Brill’s remark.</p>

<p>“But we can’t tell how long ago they were
here,” said Jim Nestor. “It’s been some time
since you hid the gold—isn’t it, Harvey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some time.”</p>

<p>“Well, the only thing to do is to start, I suppose,”
said Jerry, wearily.</p>

<p>He advanced toward the airship, with a glance
at the empty pocket where the gold had been.</p>

<p>“Stop!” suddenly exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
catching hold of Jerry’s sleeve. “I’m not
so sure the gold has been taken away—at least by
a human agency.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried the tall lad.</p>

<p>“I say I’m not so sure the gold has been taken
away.”</p>

<p>“But it’s gone; isn’t it?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes. But let me ask Mr. Brill a few questions,”
went on the scientist. “I’d like to know,”
he continued, “if this place is exactly as it was
when you hid the gold?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” declared the prospector.
“There have been quite some changes.
Of course the big rock is just the same, but those
around it seem to have been moved. And, now
that I look at it again, I can see that the pocket
isn’t in exactly the same location.”</p>

<p>“I thought so!” exclaimed the professor, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
triumph. “And now can you see any traces of
water having covered this place since you were
here?”</p>

<p>Mr. Brill glanced curiously at the scientist, and
then looked carefully around him.</p>

<p>“Water?” he repeated. “Why, yes, now that
you mention it, I should say there had been a sort
of washout or flood here.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” cried Mr. Snodgrass. “And it’s
the flood that took away the sixty nuggets—not
the grub-stakers!”</p>

<p>“A flood!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Uriah Snodgrass. “The gold
was washed out of the pocket by a rush of water.
There have been heavy rains since Mr. Brill hid
the nuggets. Or there may have been a cloud-burst,
or even an underground river may have
burst to the surface after the landslide. Whatever
happened, the gold has been washed away,
but the canvas sack caught under a rock and was
held.”</p>

<p>“But where is the gold now?” demanded Ned,
with hope in his voice.</p>

<p>“Scattered along the track taken by the flood,”
answered the scientist. “Look, you can see
which way it washed,” and, now that their attention
was called to it, they could all see traces of
the flood. There were riffles in the heavy sand,
bits of driftwood, and marks on the stones that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
showed how high the water had risen. It had
swept on down the valley.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to follow the track left by the
flood,” exclaimed the professor, “and we may
find the gold that way.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Ned. “Then everything
isn’t lost yet.”</p>

<p>“Not by a jugful!” exclaimed Jerry. “We
may get the gold yet.”</p>

<p>Eagerly they began their search, but it was
soon seen that it was not going to be an easy task.
For, a little way from the big rock that marked
the location of the pocket, they came to a wild
and desolate part of the valley, where great
stones lay piled loosely one on the other, ready
to topple over at the least disturbance.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be careful,” warned Jerry.
“We may be caught under some of those
boulders.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Professor Snodgrass.
“This is going to be a perilous search.”</p>

<p>“But we won’t give up on that account!” cried
Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess not!” agreed the two Westerners.</p>

<p>The party halted for a short time for dinner,
and then resumed looking for the gold. The
marks of the flood were plainly to be seen, and
put them on the right trail.</p>

<p>“Look low,” advised Mr. Snodgrass. “Gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
is about the heaviest metal there is, and it will
lodge low down. Look at the very bottom of
where the flood swept.”</p>

<p>Their search was indeed perilous and full of
danger. Several times one or the other of them
just managed to get out of the way as a big
boulder came crashing down. But they found not
the slightest trace of gold. It all seemed to have
vanished.</p>

<p>Bob, who had strayed ahead of the others,
leaped from one stone to another to get into a little
depression where he thought he might find
some of the yellow nuggets. As he did so he dislodged
a small stone, which fell with a crash.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was broken by a
menacing growl, and Bob, looking quickly ahead
of him, saw, crouched on the trunk of a dead tree,
a tawny yellow body—a mountain lion ready to
spring!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE SIXTY NUGGETS</small></h2>


<p>For a moment the boy and beast stood gazing
at each other. Bob felt a chill of fear run
through him, and, as he saw the quivering of the
brute, and noted the switching tail, he felt that he
wanted to scream—to cry out for help.</p>

<p>Bob noticed that the mountain lion was inch
by inch edging itself along the tree trunk, to get
to the end.</p>

<p>“And when he does,” reasoned the boy, “he’s
going to jump—and jump on me!”</p>

<p>He wanted to turn and look behind him to see
how close his friends might be, and yet he steeled
himself against any such action. For, somewhere,
he had read that the best thing to do, when
confronted by a wild beast, is to remain confronting
it, looking it directly in the eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s my only chance!” thought Bob. “The
minute I turn around he’s going to spring.”</p>

<p>He listened intently, but could hear no footsteps
approaching, and realized that he had gotten
far ahead of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, why didn’t I bring my rifle along?”
thought Bob. “None of us did, I guess. We
thought so much of the gold that we didn’t dream
we would need guns!”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer crept the beast, and now,
added to its quivering body and switching tail,
there came low, menacing growls, to inspire more
terror in the intended victim.</p>

<p>“It won’t be much longer now,” thought Bob.
“I’ve just got to turn and run. I can’t stand facing
him out! I’m going to jump back, and maybe
I can get behind a big rock, or something, long
enough to yell for help. Here goes! I’m going
to dodge!”</p>

<p>Something of his intention must have, in some
way, been made manifest to the lion, or perhaps a
sight movement on the part of the lad carried
this intelligence to the beast. For, just as Bob
was about to turn and flee, he saw the beast give
a final quiver, and then, with a roar, launch itself
into the air from the tree trunk. At the same moment
a voice shouted:</p>

<p>“Fall, Bob! Lie down! Flop to the ground!”</p>

<p>Wondering why this advice was given, but recognizing
that it came from some of his party, the
stout lad threw himself forward. He saw the
beast hurling itself toward him, and, a second
later, there came a sharp report.</p>

<p>The body of the mountain lion seemed to crumple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
up, to become a knot in midair, and then,
fairly turning a somersault, the beast crashed to
the ground just beyond where Bob lay.</p>

<p>“Roll to one side! Get out of the way!”
yelled the voice again, and Bob had presence of
mind enough to obey. He knew that the beast,
in its death agony, might reach and claw him.
So Bob, being unable to do anything else, rolled
to one side. Then, if ever, he was thankful for
his fleshiness, for he did not so much mind the
rough rocks over which his course took him.</p>

<p>Once more there came the cracking sound of a
shot, and then Bob, raising his head, saw the body
of the lion give a final quiver and lie still. It was
dead.</p>

<p>“Great Peter, that was a close call!” exclaimed
Jim Nestor, coming up as Bob arose. “I
was afraid I couldn’t plug him with my revolver,
but I managed to do it.”</p>

<p>“Did—did you shoot?” asked Bob, for his
breath was still a little short from the fright and
the exertion. “Did you shoot him, Jim?”</p>

<p>“I did, I’m thankful to say. I was following
you up, looking for the gold nuggets, when I happened
to see the pickle you were in. I knew there
was no time to yell to the others for help, and
less time to go back for a rifle. I happened to
have my big revolver with me, but I knew it was
taking desperate chances trying to plug a mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
lion with it at that distance. But it was all
the chance I had, and I took it.”</p>

<p>“And you winged him,” observed Bob, thankfully,
as he looked at the dead body. It was a
large specimen of the mountain lion family.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was lucky enough to get him with the
first bullet,” went on the miner; “but I took a
second shot to make sure. He was coming right
at you; wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He was that!” exclaimed Bob, as he shook
hands with Jim, and there was much meaning in
the clasp of their palms.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What happened?”
cried Jerry, running up from behind a turn in the
trail. He was followed by the others. “Is anyone
hurt?”</p>

<p>“That fellow is,” replied Bob, with a short
laugh, as he indicated the lion with his foot.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jerry, and then he understood,
though Bob insisted on giving details.</p>

<p>“Well, after this,” spoke Ned, “we had better
take our guns with us. There may be more of
the brutes here.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” replied Mr. Brill. “I
know one chased me when I was here before.
Yes, we’d better go armed.”</p>

<p>“And keep closer together,” added Jerry.
“Hi, Professor!” he called, for the scientist had
wandered off some distance to the side. “Don’t
go so far. Come here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you found the gold?” shouted Mr.
Snodgrass, as he came running up.</p>

<p>“No, and it doesn’t look as though we would,”
said Ned, half discouragedly. Then the professor
was told of what had happened, and urged to remain
near the others.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll find it!” declared Harvey Brill.
“Even if it was washed out of the pocket where
I hid it, we’ll find it sooner or later. Those nuggets
can’t have been washed out of the valley.”</p>

<p>“But the valley is a big place, and besides,
Noddy Nixon and his crowd may come back any
time, and make trouble for us,” went on Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must have a grouch!” exclaimed
Jerry, with a grin. “Don’t cross the bridge of
trouble until you hear the rustling of its wings,”
he misquoted.</p>

<p>Once the excitement caused by Bob’s danger
had passed, the party resumed the search for the
gold. They followed the course of the flood,
plainly visible, but, after looking carefully for
some distance, they found nothing, and even Mr.
Brill began to look disheartened.</p>

<p>“I think we had better bring the airship down
this way,” suggested Jerry, late that afternoon,
when they had gone about two miles from it.
“We won’t do any more prospecting back there,
and we might as well have the comforts of it with
us, and not have to retrace our steps.”</p>

<p>They agreed with him, and alone Jerry went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
for, and brought up the <i>Comet</i>. Then, after a
short search about the vicinity of her new anchoring
ground, they gave up work for the day, as it
was getting dark.</p>

<p>“We’ll find those nuggets sure—to-morrow!”
declared Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>But they did not, nor on the next day, though
they searched carefully. Even Professor Snodgrass
forgot his desire for new specimens in the
wish to help locate the treasure. But it seemed
that it was gone forever, having been washed
away by the flood and landslide, and deposited in
some new hiding-place destined never to be found.
Mr. Brill was much discouraged, and the others
shared his feelings.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to go back home and report
a failure,” said Bob, gloomily. “Anyhow,
we haven’t got much more grub, and maybe we’d
better take a flight out of here and get some—that
is, if we’re going to keep on with the search.”</p>

<p>“And that’s just what we’re going to do!” exclaimed
Jerry. “We’re going on with this search.
What are you talking about, Bob? There’s grub
enough for a long time yet. Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>The next day they took up the search again, but
with hearts growing more and more despondent
all the while. Several times Jerry looked off to
the distant cliffs, as if to see if he and his companions
were being watched by the grub-stakers, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Noddy Nixon. But if their enemies were there
they did not show themselves.</p>

<p>It was coming on toward evening. They had
again moved the airship, and had passed the middle
of the valley.</p>

<p>“We’re on the Canadian side of the Border
now,” remarked Mr. Brill, as he grubbed around
among the rocks.</p>

<p>“Are we?” asked Ned, indifferently. “Well,
I don’t see that it’s any luckier for us than the
good old United States were.”</p>

<p>They were about to give up the search for the
day. The sun was just sinking down behind the
cliffs of the valley, when Professor Snodgrass,
who had wandered off to one side again, gave a
cry. It was a shout of delight.</p>

<p>“He’s found something!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“The gold! Is it the gold, Mr. Snodgrass?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No!” was the disappointing answer. “But
oh, boys come here! I have just seen the largest
and most perfect specimen of a yellow jumping
spider I ever laid my eyes on! Bring me a small
net and a box, while I keep him in sight! Oh, you
beauty. You are almost as valuable as the luminous
snakes!” and the scientist fairly danced up
and down in front of a hole in the rocks.</p>

<p>“A yellow jumping spider!” half groaned
Ned. “I thought he had found some of the nuggets.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Still, as the professor had always helped
them, they could do no less than to act as he requested.
Bob brought an insect net from the scientist’s
room on the airship, and Jerry got a specimen
box. Ned and the two men followed to
where Mr. Snodgrass stood.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Mr. Brill, somewhat indifferently,
as the scientist got ready to make his
capture.</p>

<p>“Down there, between those two stones,” was
the answer, and Mr. Snodgrass pointed. “See
that yellow lump? That’s a fine yellow jumping
spider. I——”</p>

<p>But Mr. Brill interrupted him with a yell.</p>

<p>“Yellow jumping spider!” shouted the miner.
“Not in a thousand years! Great Peter, boys!
The professor’s gone and done it!”</p>

<p>“Done what?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Found the sixty nuggets of gold! Hurray!
That’s no yellow spider! It’s a yellow nugget—one
of the big ones! Wow! We’re on the trail
at last, for where there’s one there’ll be more!
Yellow spider nothing! That’s yellow gold!”
and plunging his hand and arm down in the hole
between the loose stones, the miner brought up a
lump of yellow gold as large as his fist.</p>

<p><a href="#image04">“The first of the sixty nuggets!” he shouted.</a>
“Now to find the others!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>INTERNATIONAL COMPLICATIONS</small></h2>


<p>Excitement was intense among the gold-seekers.
They crowded around Mr. Brill, eagerly
examining the nugget so strangely found, weighing
it in their hands, and rejoicing over its discovery.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the sixty!” repeated the miner,
over and over again. “Now to find the other
fifty-nine!”</p>

<p>But this was not going to be so easy as they imagined.
Feverishly they searched among the
rocks and dirt, but when darkness finally fell they
had only recovered eleven of the lumps of gold,
some larger, but most of them smaller than the
first one.</p>

<p>“But we’ll get the rest in the morning,” declared
Jim Nestor. “The box they were in must
have upset when it was washed away, and they
spilled out.”</p>

<p>This was the explanation accepted by everyone,
and, while they were disappointed in not recovering
all the gold at once, they felt that they had
good chances of ultimate success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“For it stands to reason,” said Ned, “that the
rest of the gold is somewhere around here, and
if we trace the course of the flood we’ll find it.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned were awakened early the next
morning by hearing Bob moving about the airship.
It was so very early that it was scarcely
light, and, for a moment they could not imagine
what was going on.</p>

<p>“I say, what’s up, Chunky?” demanded the
tall lad, leaning on his elbow in the comfortable
bunk of the aircraft. “It can’t be time for breakfast;
is it?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t light yet,” added Ned. “What’s the
matter, Bob? Can’t you rest?”</p>

<p>“I can sleep as good as you fellows,” was the
retort, “and I don’t see why, every time I move
around, you think I have either got to eat a
meal, or start cooking one. I’m getting tired
of it.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would be, Bob,” commented
Jerry, with dry sarcasm. “But, seriously
now, what is going on?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to start looking for the rest of the
nuggets, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Why, they won’t run away,” declared Jerry,
somewhat astonished at the unusual energy displayed
by the stout lad. “Can’t you wait until
after grub?”</p>

<p>“The quicker we find them the sooner we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
start back home,” replied Bob. “That is why I
got up so early. I want to begin the search as
quick as it’s light enough to see, and it soon will
be.”</p>

<p>“You must have some reason for the haste,”
put in Ned.</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell us?” urged Jerry.</p>

<p>“No,” and Bob’s voice was a trifle short.
“I’m going out to have a look around. When
you fellows get through snoozing you can come
and give me a hand. The professor’s up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he never sleeps,” commented Ned, with
a yawn. “Well, if you get up, Bob, I’m going
to have another forty winks,” and he turned over
and pulled the blankets around his neck, for it
was chilly in the early mornings.</p>

<p>Ned paid no further attention to his stout
chum, but Jerry regarded Bob curiously as the
latter went out of the airship.</p>

<p>“There sure is something up,” decided the tall
lad. “I wonder what it is? Chunky has something
on his mind, and he doesn’t want to tell
what it is. Maybe he has seen something of our
enemies, and he wants to hurry away from here
before they get too active. But, in that case, I
should think he’d tell us. I guess I’ll go out and
see what he’s doing.”</p>

<p>Jerry tried to arise and dress quietly, so as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to disturb Ned. But the latter’s ears were sharp,
and he turned over with a quick:</p>

<p>“Say, have you got the early rising bug, too,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d see what ailed Bob.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only he’s hungry, I’ll wager, and he
doesn’t want to admit it.”</p>

<p>“But he’s out there looking for nuggets, and
he didn’t take a bite to eat.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t! Then there sure must be something
wrong. I guess I’d better get up, too;
though it’s a shame, for I could have had another
nap. It’s early yet,” and Ned glanced reproachfully
at his tall chum, and then at a clock on the
wall, its dial faintly illuminated in the light of
the newly-dawning day.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s pulling you out of bed,” retorted
Jerry. “But it’s hardly fair to let Bob do all the
hunting alone, even if he did get up of his own
accord.”</p>

<p>The boys dressed silently, not wanting to
arouse the others in the craft, though Professor
Snodgrass was already up, as he usually was, before
dawn each day, to get insects and bugs that
were only abroad at that early hour.</p>

<p>“Find any, Bob?” sung out Jerry, as he neared
his stout chum, who was walking along, his head
bent over, making a course along the recent flood,
as nearly as he could trace it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nope,” was the somewhat gloomy response.
“There doesn’t seem to be a one. But maybe,
now that you fellows have condescended to come
out, we may pick up a few. Scatter out a bit, so
we won’t go over the same ground twice,” he
added, as Ned joined them.</p>

<p>“Look here, Chunky!” exclaimed Ned. “You
must have some object in getting up so early and
beginning this search.”</p>

<p>“I have. I want to find the nuggets.”</p>

<p>“I know, but you must have a special reason.
What is it? If it’s trouble, Jerry and I have a
right to know. We’re just as much in this thing
as you are.”</p>

<p>Bob looked cautiously around. No one was in
sight save Professor Snodgrass, and he was so
much engaged in trying to creep upon, and capture,
a specimen of an eight-toed lizard that was
trying to get away that he had no idea the boys
were even up.</p>

<p>“There is a reason,” went on the stout lad.
“I want to find the nuggets as soon as we can,
because our food supply is running low, and I
know Mr. Brill won’t want to leave here until we
get the last of the sixty nuggets. So the quicker
we find them the sooner we can leave, and get
stocked up again. We can’t get anything to eat
here.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “But I had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
idea our stock was so low. We must have eaten
a lot.”</p>

<p>“You mean <em>Bob</em> must have,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried the stout lad; “I didn’t
eat any more than the rest of you—that is, not
much more,” he added, quickly. “But our food
is fast going down. Maybe we didn’t calculate
right. Anyhow we’ve been here longer than we
thought we would. Now I don’t want to starve,
so I decided that I’d put in all the time I could
on locating these nuggets. That’s why I got up
so early.”</p>

<p>“I knew there was eating in it somewhere or
other,” declared Jerry, with a nod of his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you knew a lot, you did!” retorted
Bob. “Always casting it up to me. I wish——”</p>

<p>“Say, cut it out, you fellows,” advised Ned.
“If it’s as Chunky says, I don’t want to waste any
time, either. Let’s get busy.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d get sense,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>Together they hunted along the course of the
flood, separating so as to cover as much ground
as possible. But that early-morning search was
unavailing. The light gradually became better,
the golden sun, flooding down into the valley; but
even the bright rays did not reveal any of the yellow
nuggets amid the rocks and stones.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s going to take longer than we
thought,” remarked Bob, gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, just how much longer will our food
last?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe a week, or a week and a
half,” began Bob, “but——”</p>

<p>“A week!” cried Ned. “And you’ve been
throwing this scare into us with a week’s rations
on hand! Getting me up, to lose my beauty sleep,
and all that!”</p>

<p>“I’d duck him if it wasn’t so far to the water,”
groaned Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, a week’s supply isn’t any too much,”
declared Bob, defending his course. “Come on,
now. We might as well keep on searching until
it’s time for breakfast. It will give us good appetites,
and it’s early yet.”</p>

<p>“As if you needed an appetite,” muttered
Jerry, as his eyes roved over the ground.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, giving over his attempt
to capture the particular specimen he was after,
came up to where the boys were.</p>

<p>“Have you found anything?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing in your line, I guess, Professor,”
answered Ned. “We were looking for—Look
at that!” he cried quickly. “There may
be something you want, Mr. Snodgrass. There!
Right between those two black stones!</p>

<p>“It’s some sort of a toad. Wait, I’ll get it for
you before it can hop away,” and Ned was about
to plunge his bare hand down in a crevice among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the stones, when the little scientist sprang forward
and drew him back so forcibly that the lad
sprawled on the ground.</p>

<p>“What—what’s the matter?” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“That toad!” cried the scientist. “It’s deadly
poisonous. It’s a spined toad—not a horned one,
though it looks like that species. It’s worse than
a rattlesnake. If you had touched it and it had
poisoned you, why, you might have died, though
some persons have been known to recover. Never
touch one.”</p>

<p>“I—I thought you’d like it for a specimen,”
murmured Ned, frightened by his narrow escape.</p>

<p>“So I would, but it must be handled with a net.
I’ll show you. I didn’t mean to pull you back so
quickly, but I once had a friend who nearly lost
his life because of a sting from one of those creatures,
and I thought you would touch it before I
could stop you. Ah, now I have it!” and, with
a quick motion of his insect net, the scientist captured
the ugly-looking creature, which was soon
painlessly killed by the cyanide-bottle process.</p>

<p>Then they resumed their search for the nuggets,
but by breakfast time they had found none.</p>

<p>However, after the meal, which Bob looked at
as though it might be their last, they resumed
their quest. Eagerly they searched, and before
noon they were rewarded by locating a few of the
precious nuggets. Then they became more eager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
dividing up the territory so as not to cover the
same ground twice.</p>

<p>So busily were they engaged—even Professor
Snodgrass doing his full share—that none of
them thought to take an occasional observation of
the distant cliffs. Had they done so, they might
have seen several figures looking down at them,
though for the most part, the figures kept well
concealed.</p>

<p>And, had they heard the talk that went on
among the spies they would have felt they had
good cause for alarm, for one of them was Jake
Paxton, the man who had been lowered over the
cliff.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no fake about it this time,”
said Paxton. “They’re not after snakes now.”</p>

<p>“I knew they’d look for the gold sooner or
later,” declared one of the party.</p>

<p>“Well, you were right after all, Noddy,”
came the retort. “And now we’ve got to consider
how we can get it away from them. I guess
the mounted police will be our best play.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jerry and his friends were finding
nugget after nugget. They were considerably
scattered by the flood, but once the gold had
rolled out of the box, it had sunk, and had not
been carried more than a comparatively short distance.</p>

<p>“Well, if we had three more we’d have ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
all,” said Bob, toward the close of that memorable
day. “We have fifty-seven so far.”</p>

<p>“Fifty-eight!” cried Ned quickly, as he
stooped and held up another of the yellow lumps.
“We only need two more.”</p>

<p>“Let’s let them go,” suggested the stout lad.
“I’m afraid our grub——”</p>

<p>“Drop that, Chunky!” cried Jerry. “We’ll
stay until we get the whole sixty nuggets, if we
have to live on half rations!”</p>

<p>Bob groaned, and hastened off to the kitchen
to take an account of the food remaining. He
came back, looking rather serious, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Those two last nuggets aren’t so very large,”
suggested Mr. Brill. “If you boys want to go
back——”</p>

<p>“We’ll get ’em all!” exclaimed Jerry. “The
folks back home expect us to, and we will. Why,
there’s no special hurry, and I’m sure we’ll find
them soon. I——”</p>

<p>“Here’s one!” interrupted Jim Nestor, as he
located a small lump of yellow metal, where it
had lodged between two stones. “And great
Peter!” he yelled a moment later, “here’s the
twin! Hurray, boys! We’ve got ’em all—the
whole sixty nuggets of gold!”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Jerry, while Bob said:</p>

<p>“Now we can go, and we won’t have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
starve,” and there was a brighter look on his
face.</p>

<p>It was true enough. A count showed that
every one of the sixty nuggets had been found,
and it was good work, considering how scattered
they had been. But the searchers had certain advantages
on their side, and nature, in a way, had
aided them.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon we’ll start for home in the
morning,” remarked Bob, a little later that evening,
when they were seated about the supper table.
The sixty nuggets were piled in a box in the
cabin, where all could see them, and they
glowed richly yellow in the glare of the electric
lights.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve gotten all we came for,” spoke
Jerry, “and I guess we can leave the valley in the
morning. Our quest couldn’t have been any more
successful.”</p>

<p>“And I got what I came for!” exclaimed the
professor, as he looked at his luminous snakes.
“I wish I could have gotten a yellow jumping
spider,” he went on with a sigh; “but I will look
for that next.”</p>

<p>“‘All’s well that ends well,’” quoted Ned.
“And now I’m going to turn in—I’m tired.”</p>

<p>It began to rain in the night, and when morning
came our friends faced most disagreeable
weather. It was cold, and a strong wind dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the rain against the windows of the motorship.
But they did not mind the elements now, for,
snugly within the <i>Comet</i>, they did not feel their inclemency.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” cried Jerry, soon after breakfast.
“Turn on the gas, Ned, and we’ll go up as
a balloon until we get out of this valley. I don’t
want any accidents.”</p>

<p>The great motorship arose, and through the
mist and rain ascended from the valley of the luminous
snakes and the sixty nuggets of gold. The
wind increased in violence as they got above the
protecting sides of rock, and when they reached
the top of the big gulch the <i>Comet</i> was fairly
heeled over in spite of her powerful propellers.</p>

<p>“Some blow, this!” gasped Jerry, as he labored
to shift the rudder.</p>

<p>“Can we weather it?” asked Jim, who was in
the pilot house with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so. But I’ll be glad when it’s
over.”</p>

<p>“We’re on the Canadian side,” returned Mr.
Nestor, as he looked down, and took note of the
landmarks.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be in our own country,” went on
Jerry, “though we could make it quicker if this
wind wasn’t against us.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he ceased speaking when from below
them came several sharp cracks, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
same time the airship seemed to hesitate and falter.
Then it began to sink slightly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” yelled the miner.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong with the gas bag!” answered
Jerry, who saw by the vapor gauge before
him that they were losing buoyancy. Then from
the observation cabin where he had gone, Bob
yelled:</p>

<p>“There’s a crowd just below us, and they’re
shooting at us, too! They’re aiming at the gas
bag!”</p>

<p>“I thought so!” murmured Jerry. The
<i>Comet</i> lurched to one side, and settled more and
more.</p>

<p>“Shut off the motor, Ned!” cried the tall lad.
“We’ve got to go down!”</p>

<p>They descended gently, in a comparatively level
place, and as Jerry could tell that there were several
punctures in the gas bag, he turned off the
supply of vapor, and set the pump going that
forced it back into the steel container, where it
was compressed. The big bag collapsed into its
frame.</p>

<p>They had come down on top of the cliffs surrounding
the valley, and, hardly had they settled
than a crowd of horsemen rode up, surrounding
them. Jerry saw that one or two wore the uniform
of the Canadian mounted police, and, to
his surprise, in the throng were Noddy Nixon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and Bill Berry, and the man with the scar whom
the tall lad had seen in the railroad station.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” yelled Jim Nestor,
angrily. “Why have you shot at us?”</p>

<p>“To stop you,” replied one of the police. “We
are sorry, but it was the only way. We had to
stop you.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Because you are taking over the Border gold
secured in the Dominion of Canada, in violation
of the international law. You must give up that
gold. It belongs to the Crown.”</p>

<p>“It does not! It belongs to me!” yelled
Harvey Brill.</p>

<p>“Our information is to the contrary,” spoke
the leader of the police. “We regret that we
had to fire on your balloon, and are sorry if we
damaged it much. But in a case like this, involving
international complications, it was the only
thing to do. We had to stop you before you got
over the Border.”</p>

<p>“And who told you this gold was not mine?”
asked Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>With a motion the police officer indicated
Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” murmured Jerry. “Well,
we’ll fight this thing out to the end now. I see
his game!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>A FLIGHT BY NIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“Young man,” said the chief of the mounted
officers, “I heard what you said, and I want to
warn you to be careful.” His tone was firm, but
respectful, and Jerry, looking at the group of
those surrounding the crippled airship, saw a
grin of malicious delight on the face of Noddy
Nixon.</p>

<p>“We are going to stand up for our rights,”
said the tall lad.</p>

<p>“I can’t blame you for that,” went on the officer.
“But don’t talk of fighting. We are in
authority here. I might add that under the circumstances,
and in view of the information given
to us, we could only act as we did and halt you.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the whole story?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but I am informed that you are citizens
of the United States, that you have in your possession
gold taken from the Dominion of Canada,
and that you propose to take it into the
United States, across the Border, in violation not
only of the customs laws, but of the international<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
law regarding treasure as well. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it is—in a measure,” admitted
Jerry. “But I should like to tell you the
whole story. Will you come in, you and the
other officers?”</p>

<p>“We will be glad to,” said the mounted man,
in more genial tones. “We are sorry for what
we had to do, but we must enforce the laws.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the tall lad. “Maybe
you’ll feel differently after you hear all the
facts.”</p>

<p>The men tied their horses to some trees, and
approached the airship through the mist that
was falling. Noddy and some of his cronies
started to follow, evidently not liking it in the
storm.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried Jim Nestor, barring
the way of all save the police. “You fellows
can stay out. Harvey, get busy here. There’s
some undesirable citizens trying to get in,” and
the two Westerners proved an effectual barrier
against the plotters.</p>

<p>Jerry lost little time in telling the story of the
search for the gold, adding his suspicions of how
Noddy Nixon had followed them, and joined
forces with the unscrupulous men who had first
tried to take Mr. Brill’s wealth from him.</p>

<p>“It is true that we found the gold in Canada,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
explained Jerry; “but it was washed there, after
being dug in the United States, and only by accident
did it get over the Border. We surely had
a right to recover our own property, and bring
it back.”</p>

<p>“Hum! That puts a different face on it,”
said the chief officer, obviously much puzzled.
“I did not know that. I will have to report to
my superiors,” he went on. “It will take some
little time, and I am sorry for the delay caused
you. If what you say is true, and I have no reason
to doubt it, we have no jurisdiction over you.
I shall at once ride to the nearest telegraph station
and make a full report of the matter to my
superiors. Then if everything turns out as I expect
it will, you may go.”</p>

<p>He and his companions left, after Jerry had
insisted on their taking some hot coffee which
Bob made. As they got outside, the mounted
police were surrounded by Noddy and his cronies,
eager to learn what had taken place in the
airship. That they were disappointed by the
outcome was evident.</p>

<p>“They’re going to have their own troubles
getting hold of this gold!” declared Mr. Brill,
grimly.</p>

<p>“And if they make any move toward my luminous
snakes!” exclaimed the professor, “I—I’ll
fight ’em—that’s what I will!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The mounted officers rode off in the storm,
and Noddy and his companions made a rough
camp not far from the stalled airship.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Jerry?” asked
Ned, as dinner time drew near. “Stay here and
wait for those officers to come back?”</p>

<p>“I am not!” declared the tall youth.</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“We leave here to-night!”</p>

<p>“To-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know what the decision will be—in
our favor—and there is no use staying here and
taking chances with that crowd,” and he nodded
toward the campers.</p>

<p>“The gold is ours,” he went on, “and we have
a right to take it where we please. The mounted
police admitted as much. It was all a bluff on
the part of Noddy’s crowd to make trouble.
Maybe they thought they could, in some way,
get possession of the nuggets. But we’ll fool ’em.
We’ll slip away to-night—after dark.”</p>

<p>“But how can we—when the gas bag is full of
holes?” asked Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>“We’ll go as an aeroplane,” declared Jerry.
“There is enough level ground here for a start,
and those police won’t be back before morning.”</p>

<p>Night settled down, a cold, windy, stormy
night, and Noddy and his cronies in their camp
were anything but comfortable. They seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to be waiting for the return of the police, but the
Westerners expressed the belief that the lawless
men might try to rush the airship after dark and
take the gold.</p>

<p>“We’ll stop ’em if they do,” declared Jim
Nestor, grimly.</p>

<p>Strict watch was kept, and in the shelter of
the craft Jerry and his chums went over all the
machinery. They would not need to use the gas
apparatus to get over the Border.</p>

<p>“I think there’s something doing out there,”
reported Mr. Brill, about nine o’clock, coming in
from the outer deck where he had been keeping
watch on the camp. “It looks like they were
coming this way.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em come,” replied Jerry. “We’re
ready to start. Turn on the motor, Ned!”</p>

<p>With a rush and a roar the <i>Comet</i> shot across
the ground. There was a chorus of surprised
cries, and one or two rifle shots. Then, like a
bird, the motorship sailed aloft, leaving the disappointed
plotters behind.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“For the good old U. S. A.!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Over the Border, and all the mounted police
in Canada can’t touch us!” spoke Jerry, gleefully.
“I think we’ve fooled ’em. They didn’t
think we would, or could, go.”</p>

<p>The cries and rifle shots died away in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
darkness and the <i>Comet</i> swept on, out of
danger.</p>

<p>Of the return trip little need be written. By
morning they were over the Border, in their own
country, and out of Canadian jurisdiction. They
found a good place, and made a descent to repair
the gas bag, for they could not tell when it
might be needed. The storm was at an end, and
in the sunny weather their spirits revived wonderfully.
Many times during the course of the
repairs they stopped to look at the gold, while
Professor Snodgrass lovingly viewed his luminous
snakes.</p>

<p>“Oh, but we sure had adventures this trip!”
exclaimed Ned, when they were ready to start off
again.</p>

<p>“Yes, it came near to beating anything else
we ever did,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to settle down now, for a
while,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Settle down! I guess not!” cried Jerry.
“We’ll have some more fun as soon as we can,”
and how they did it, and what it was, will be related
in the next volume of this series, to be
called “The Motor Boys Under the Sea; Or,
From Airship to Submarine.”</p>

<p>Once more they were on the wing. The <i>Comet</i>
swept along at wonderful speed and soon they
were back at Kabspell, where they intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
take their motorship apart, and go home by train,
with the gold and the professor’s snakes.</p>

<p>Everything went off well, and the troubles they
had coming West were not repeated on the trip
East. How Noddy fared with the grub-stakers
who sought to get the gold they did not learn for
some time later, but they did hear that the
mounted police returned to the place where they
had left the airship, intending to report that they
had no jurisdiction, and that Jerry and his chums
could do just as they pleased. But the motor
boys had done it anyhow.</p>

<p>The gold proved to be of more value than was
thought, and the syndicate of the boys’ parents
received their money back with good interest.
Jim Nestor and Harvey Brill purchased their
mine, and are still working it. In fact it paid so
well that Mr. Brill could help most of his poor
relations, including the stout aunt. Jake Paxton
and Ike Weldon, the chief plotters of the grub-stakers,
got into trouble soon after their disappointing
trip to the Border, and had to flee the
country. Noddy and Bill came back, much chastened
in spirit. The Blackfeet Indians, after
their little excursion, were safely driven back on
the reservation.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder if Professor Snodgrass got
his luminous snakes safely to the museum?” said
Ned to his chums one day several weeks later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I had a letter from him,” spoke Jerry.
“He said he had received another honorary degree.
He’s got more letters to his name now
than ever.”</p>

<p>“But, all the same, he’s a nice man,” observed
Bob, who was munching a piece of cake, his
chums having called at his house.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is,” agreed Ned. “Say, let’s
go for a motorboat ride, and talk over where
we’ll spend the summer vacation,” and with the
motor boys thus on pleasure bent we will say
good-bye to them.</p>

<p class="noi adtitle">The Racer Boys At Boarding School<br />
<small>or Striving for the Championship</small></p>

<p>When the Racer Boys arrived at the school they found everything at
a stand-still. The school was going down rapidly and the students
lacked ambition and leadership. The Racers took hold with a will,
and got their father to aid the head of the school financially, and then
reorganized the football team.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">Ever since the success of Mr. Chadwick’s
“College Sports Series” we have been urged
to get him to write a series dealing exclusively
with baseball, a subject in which he is unexcelled
by any living American author or
coach.</p>


<p class="noi adtitle">Baseball Joe of the Silver Stars<br />
<small>or The Rivals of Riverside</small></p>

<p>In this volume, the first of the series, Joe is introduced as an everyday
country boy who loves to play baseball and is particularly anxious to
make his mark as a pitcher. He finds it almost impossible to get on
the local nine, but, after a struggle, he succeeds, although much
frowned upon by the star pitcher of the club. A splendid picture of
the great national game in the smaller towns of our country.</p>


<p class="noi adtitle">Baseball Joe on the School Nine<br />
<small>or Pitching for the Blue Banner</small></p>

<p>Joe’s great ambition was to go to boarding school and play on the
school team. He got to boarding school but found it harder making
the team there than it was getting on the nine at home. He fought
his way along, however, and at last saw his chance and took it, and
made good.</p>


<p class="noi adtitle">Baseball Joe at Yale<br />
<small>or Pitching for the College Championship</small></p>

<p>From a preparatory school Baseball Joe goes to Yale University
He makes the freshman nine and in his second year becomes a varsity
pitcher and pitches in several big games.</p>
